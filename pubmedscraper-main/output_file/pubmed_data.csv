Naturopathy.,"Smith MJ, Logan AC.",Med Clin North Am. 2002 Jan;86(1):173-84. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7125(03)00079-8.,11795088,"Naturopathic medicine is an eclectic form of primary health care that encompasses many complementary modalities in the treatment and prevention of disease. Treatment protocols are integrative in nature, combining the most suitable therapies to address the individual patient's needs. Although naturopathic physicians often are referred to as general practitioners of complementary medicine, practitioners share a common philosophical belief in the profession's founding principles. Naturopathic physicians have started to contribute to research and incorporate modern scientific methods into clinical practice, which has served to develop and validate the profession further. In contrast to many other forms of complementary medicine, naturopathic medicine is regulated partially by law. Legislation of naturopathic medicine has worked well in jurisdictions where it is legislated and has led to uniform standards of education and practice. In addition, regulation has helped with integration and naturopathic cooperation with all other branches of medical science. Within licensed jurisdictions, patients receiving naturopathic care can expect the practitioner to be held to high standards, established by state or provincial law. As alternative therapies become more integrated in nature, conventional medicine will face new challenges. Licensed naturopathic physicians are trained sufficiently to play an active role in this new primary health care team. Although the exact role has yet to be determined, the eclectic approach taken by naturopathic physicians may be of benefit in this evolutionary process."
[Naturopathy and complementary medicine in small animal science - definitions and contents].,"Stanossek I, Wehrend A.",Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere. 2021 Jun;49(3):206-210. doi: 10.1055/a-1480-5642. Epub 2021 Jun 22.,34157762,"Naturopathic and complementary procedures attain increasing popularity in veterinary medicine. A common understanding of definitions and contents of these fields is crucial for communication between pet owners and veterinarians. This paper reviews the existing definitions and the various contents of naturopathy and complementary veterinary medicine as well as their assigned treatment options. Naturopathy includes phytotherapy, hydro-therapy, thermotherapy, electrotherapy, manual therapy/chiropractic/osteopathy, and dietetic treatment. Homeopathy, homotoxicology, Traditional Chinese Medicine including acu-puncture and Chinese herbal medicine, neural therapy, organotherapy and Bach flower remedies are known as complementary treatments. The level of evidence based on scientific literature and the opportunity for certification procedures differ between treatment modalities. In the area of small animal medicine, the most extensive body of literature is available on the subject of acupuncture, in part comprising high evidence levels."
Naturopathy: a critical appraisal.,Atwood KC 4th.,MedGenMed. 2003 Dec 30;5(4):39.,14745386,"""Naturopathic medicine"" is a recent manifestation of the field of naturopathy, a 19th-century health movement espousing ""the healing power of nature."" ""Naturopathic physicians"" now claim to be primary care physicians proficient in the practice of both ""conventional"" and ""natural"" medicine. Their training, however, amounts to a small fraction of that of medical doctors who practice primary care. An examination of their literature, moreover, reveals that it is replete with pseudoscientific, ineffective, unethical, and potentially dangerous practices. Despite this, naturopaths have achieved legal and political recognition, including licensure in 13 states and appointments to the US Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee. This dichotomy can be explained in part by erroneous representations of naturopathy offered by academic medical centers and popular medical Web sites."

The Relevance of Naturopathy as a Therapeutic Tool in the Modern Era: A Narrative Review.,"Dewangan S, Kumar BB.",Altern Ther Health Med. 2024 Apr;30(4):38-41.,38702164,"Background:                    There are numerous reports of remarkable recoveries from diseases through drugless healing systems. In an effort to enhance the understanding of naturopathic therapies, the author, a renowned BNYS doctor specializing in naturopathy, yoga, nutrition, and wellness, aims to explain the importance of drugless therapies in various disease conditions.              Objective:                    To provide a comprehensive overview of the relevance and efficacy of naturopathy as a therapeutic tool in modern healthcare. Drawing on a literature review and the author's expertise, it aims to explore the benefits of drugless healing systems.              Methods:                    This study adopts a narrative review methodology to synthesize existing literature on the efficacy of naturopathy as a therapeutic tool in modern healthcare settings. A comprehensive search strategy was employed, utilizing databases such as PubMed, with keywords including ""naturopathy,"" ""drugless healing,"" ""alternative medicine,"" ""therapeutic modalities,"" and specific interventions such as ""hydrotherapy"" and ""acupuncture."" Boolean operators were used to combine terms to ensure the inclusivity of relevant literature. The intervention under investigation involved the effects of naturopathy, fasting, hydrotherapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, acupressure, magnet therapy, therapeutic manipulation, color healing, and other drugless ‎therapies. The primary focus of the reviewed studies was to evaluate the efficacy of naturopathic interventions in improving health outcomes across diverse disease conditions, including cardiac health, skin diseases, cancers, immunity, and metabolic syndrome.              Results:                    The review identified a significant body of literature supporting the efficacy of naturopathic interventions in improving health outcomes across various disease conditions. Studies consistently reported positive effects of drugless healing modalities, including improvements in cardiac health, skin diseases, cancers, immunity, and metabolic syndrome.              Conclusion:                    The findings highlight the relevance and effectiveness of naturopathy as a therapeutic approach in modern healthcare. With its emphasis on lifestyle modifications and non-invasive treatments, naturopathy offers a holistic and cost-effective alternative for addressing lifestyle disorders and enhancing overall well-being."

Natural medicinal resources and their therapeutic applications.,"Ziemska J, Szynal T, Mazańska M, Solecka J.",Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig. 2019;70(4):407-413. doi: 10.32394/rpzh/2019.0093.,31961104,"Natural medicinal resources are a country’s natural wealth. Natural medicinal waters, medicinal gases, and peloids have many properties that enable their use in the treatment of gastrointestinal, circulatory, respiratory, bone and joint, and skin and soft tissue disorders. Balneotherapy can be also applicable in prevention of many diseases and rehabilitation. At present, because there are several chemicals of synthetic origin, there is a need to search for nonpharmacological approaches and explore natural healing sources, which better fit the human body. Compared to synthetic drugs, these resources rarely show side effects, which increases the comfort of therapy. The use of natural medicinal resources in the form of treatments in health resort medicine centers under the supervision of balneologists, combined with the healing properties of the climate, contributes not only to the reduction of treatment time for many diseases but also to improvement of therapy’s results. The article discusses natural medicinal resources and some of their therapeutic applications."

Non-communicable diseases (NCD's) are rising like a major threat to human survival, which is expected to account for 75% of the total mortality by 2030. Lifestyle and behavioural changes are reckoned as the way ahead. Yoga and Naturopathy, a drugless system of medicine has intersecting paradigms which addresses all planes of health effectively. Yoga and Naturopathy through its holistic approach educate and make the people responsible for their own health. It has shown its efficacy in alleviating and preventing various NCD's. A systematic approach should be initiated, which can channelize the integration of Yoga and Naturopathy at the primary care level considering its cost-effectiveness and efficacy over NCD's."
Molecular targets of naturopathy in cancer research: bridge to modern medicine.,"Ahmad A, Ginnebaugh KR, Li Y, Padhye SB, Sarkar FH.",Nutrients. 2015 Jan 6;7(1):321-34. doi: 10.3390/nu7010321.,25569626,"The relevance of naturopathy (defined as the practice of medicine for the treatment of human diseases with natural agents) in human cancer is beginning to be appreciated, as documented by renewed interest in nutraceutical research, the natural anticancer agents of dietary origin. Because of their pleiotropic effects and the ability to modulate multiple signaling pathways, which is a good attribute of natural agents, nutraceuticals have frequently been demonstrated to re-sensitize drug-resistant cancers. The effectiveness of nutraceuticals can be further enhanced if the tools for the relative assessment of their molecular targets are readily available. Such information can be critical for determining their most effective uses. Here, we discuss the anticancer potential of nutraceuticals and the associated challenges that have interfered with their translational potential as a naturopathic approach for the management of cancers. In the years to come, an efficient screening and assessment of molecular targets will be the key to make rapid progress in the area of drug design and discovery, especially focusing on evidence-based development of naturopathy for the treatment of human malignancies."

This term is neither positively coloured nor negatively and does not include, that these methods are ineffective--it just signifies, that (at least until now) the effectivity could not be proved unobjectionably. Of course, just these methods have to be examined carefully in regard to their basic theory, their claim of efficiency and their relation of benefit and risk. Undoubtedly there are also some other methods mostly with a magic-occult base which can only be defined by the term ""paramedicine""."

Providing naturopathic care in the community: Perspectives of recent naturopathy graduates in Australia.,"Steel A, Diezel H, Leach M, Bugarcic A.",Complement Ther Clin Pract. 2023 May;51:101737. doi: 10.1016/j.ctcp.2023.101737. Epub 2023 Feb 15.,36801647,"Background and purpose:                    Naturopathy is a traditional medicine system originating from Europe and naturopathic practitioners provide care to 6.2% of Australians in a 12-month period. Australian naturopathic programs have undertaken a slow transition over the last 20 years from Advanced diploma to Bachelor degree as the minimum level of qualification for entry into the profession. This study aimed to understand and describe the experience of naturopathic graduates completing Bachelor degree and transitioning to provide naturopathic care in the community.              Materials and methods:                    Qualitative semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with graduates of Bachelor's degree naturopathy programs, within five years of completing their studies. The data were analysed using Framework analysis methods.              Results:                    The analysis identified three related themes: (1) Love for looking after patients, but clinical practice is not easy, (2) Finding a place in the naturopathic profession and in the health system; and (3) Protecting the future of the profession and practice through registration.              Conclusion:                    Graduates of Australian Bachelor's degree naturopathic programs face challenges as they attempt to find a place within their professional community. By identifying these challenges the profession's leaders may be able to develop initiatives to better support graduates and increase the success of new naturopaths."
Perception of naturopathy for female patients with metastatic gynecological cancer: A qualitative study.,"Legenne M, Chirac A, Ruer M, Reix F, Filbet M.",Palliat Support Care. 2015 Dec;13(6):1663-8. doi: 10.1017/S1478951515000553. Epub 2015 May 28.,26016778,"Objective:                    Women with gynecological cancer have been reported as very high users of complementary medicine. The goal of our study was to explore the perceptions of patients with an advanced gynecological cancer who use naturopathy as complementary medicine. We were looking more specifically at patients' opinions on the effect of naturopathy on their quality of life and its relation to conventional oncological treatments.              Method:                    This pilot qualitative study used semistructured interviews, and data were analyzed using grounded theory and qualitative methods. The main criterion for inclusion in the study was the use of naturopathy as a treatment complementary to conventional cancer treatment for gynecological metastatic cancer on the oncology day care unit.              Results:                    Six patients were included until data saturation. They express the physical and psychological impact of treatments and disease. Usually, chemotherapy is perceived as something that may be curative or may at least lead to remission. Unlike conventional treatments, naturopathy is not perceived as drugs, and it is seen as a way to relieve symptoms, improve well-being, and as a way of enabling them to take an active decision-making role in their care journey. Patients want to have more information about naturopathy.              Significance of results:                    This study suggests that patients are aware of the benefits of a specific cancer treatment as chemotherapy, but they resort to naturopathy for symptom control, and also to take a more active role during treatment."

Objective:                    Who formed the term Ordnungstherapie in naturopathy and what does it mean?              Material and methods:                    Heuristics and criticism of literature of the 20th century as well as database research.              Results:                    Nowadays in German-language medical books Ordnungstherpie belongs to the five therapeutics which define European naturopathy. Yet, the interpretation ranges from health education to body-orientated forms of psychotherapy. The term Ordnungstherapie is often related with the German priest and hydropath Sebastian Kneipp, however, term and definition have been founded by the Swiss physician Maximillian Bircher-Benner. In 1937 he defined Ordnungstherapie as a complex concept of natural healing. It is based upon the rather nosological idea that health is order/harmony in the human body (physically, psychologically), the environment and the daily course. Illness occurs if disorder appears in one of these fields. The therapeutic setting of Ordnungstherapy is defined by 9 rules of conduct to maintain order, which include nutrition, the skin as an organ (exposure to light, air, water), breathing, movement, rhythm of life, and psyche. For all these aspects Bircher-Benner himself uses the terms somatotherapy (dietotherapy, sun and light therapy, hydrotherapy, exercise therapy, breathing technique, order of the rhythm of live) and psychotherapy. He chose these complementary methods subjectively after learning them from 1897 onwards in an eclectic manner and after gaining therapeutic empiricism. Nevertheless his ideas of the Ordnungstherapie correlate with the socio-political context of the 1940ies.              Conclusions:                    The term Ordnungstherapie was introduced by Bircher-Benner as an umbrella term in 1937 to describe a complex concept of naturopathic therapies. It comprises, with certain limitations for phytotherapy, the therapies which nowadays define European naturopathy. Yet, in European naturopathy today Ordnungstherapie is mostly considered as one out of 5 constituents of naturopathy (dietotherapy, hydrotherapy, exercise therapy, phytotherapy, Ordnungstherapie). The classification of Ordnungstherapie as one of the 5 pillars of the Kneipp therapy was only done by Kneipp physicians in the middle of the 20th century and needs to be thought over."

Epub 2023 Mar 21.,36944124,"Introduction: The World Health Organization identified health to be the most important social goal and the 1978 Declaration of Alma Ata placed primary health care central to its attainment and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the template. The Astana Declaration called on a change of focus in primary care, from treatment of specific diseases to the prevention and inclusion of both scientific and traditional knowledge. Such objectives require public-private partnerships in providing health care, including traditional and complementary medicine systems such as naturopathy that align. However, there is limited understanding of global regulatory frameworks and officially recognized training for naturopathy. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study employs an adapted mixed-methods explanatory framework to examine naturopathy regulation and education. Analysis merges data arising from a descriptive policy analysis of regulation from 36 countries and survey analysis from 65 naturopathic organizations from 29 countries. Results: Four types of workforce regulation were identified within 107 countries where naturopathy was practiced-statutory registration or occupational licensing, coregulation, negative licensing, and voluntary certification. No form of naturopathic regulation was most common. Higher graduate/postgraduate education and access to a broader range of practices were more frequently reported in countries where naturopathy is statutory regulated. Government audits were more frequently reported where naturopathy was statutory regulated or coregulated. Discussion: Naturopathic philosophy and practice align with primary health care goals outlined in the Declaration of Astana. The naturopathic workforce represents an untapped health care resource with a demonstrated track record of translating these aspirational goals into practice. However, naturopathy remains inconsistently regulated globally, serving as a significant barrier to partnering with other health system actors to attain the health-related SDGs. Workforce regulation for the naturopathic profession offers increased standards, reduced risks, integrative health workforce planning, and assistance to countries toward achieving the promise of the Declaration of Astana."

Epub 2006 Jun 6.,16759776,"Whereas naturopathic physicians have either ""licensure"" or state-mandated ""registration"" in 13 US states and four Canadian provinces, naturopaths in Australia have thus far failed to obtain ""statutory registration"" in any political jurisdiction, despite the fact that chiropractors and osteopaths have done so in all Australian states and territories, and acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners have done so in the state of Victoria. Ironically, naturopathy and various other complementary medical systems are taught in many public tertiary institutions. This essay presents an overview of the development and the current socio-political status of naturopathy in Australia and its redefinition in some contexts as ""natural therapies"" and ""natural medicine"" or even as the major component of complementary medicine. It also examines reasons why the Australian state has come to express an interest in naturopathy along with other complementary medical systems."

Over 75% of respondents utilized detoxification therapies primarily to treat patients for environmental exposures, general cleansing/preventive medicine, gastrointestinal disorders, and autoimmune disease. Regarding methods used, >75% reported using dietary measures, reducing environmental exposures, and using botanicals as detoxification therapies. Eighty-three percent (83%) of NDs surveyed reported using follow-up measurements to determine efficacy of detoxification therapies. The most common were patient symptom questionnaires (66%), patient medical histories (54%), and urinary provocative challenge testing (53%).              Conclusions:                    The majority of NDs responding to this survey reported routine use of clinical detoxification therapies to treat a range of medical conditions utilizing multiple therapeutic approaches. Although the majority of NDs reported using some follow-up measurements after detoxification therapy, few of these are an objective means to determine treatment efficacy. Further research is needed in the field of complementary and alternative medicine clinical detoxification to determine the safety and efficacy of these approaches."
[Special therapeutic practices from the viewpoint of naturopathy].,Bühring M.,Z Arztl Fortbild Qualitatssich. 1997 Nov;91(7):674-81.,9527467,"Naturopathy being orientated towards natural science and conventional medicine does not lead to basically different judgements about unconventional treatments nor about special therapies such as homeopathy, phytotherapy or anthroposophic medicine. It may, however, be more open-minded towards new ideas and theoretical even philosophical concepts and it is more likely used to question the 'state of the art' of actual medical knowledge. It is only for a relatively small part of unconventional treatments, that naturopathy recognizes a certain plausibility, which causes scientific investigation of the method to be meaningful. Naturopathy sometimes proposes traditional anthropologies and nosologies to be used for the election of suitable indications. A variety of psychologic effects of different methods of naturopathy may not be excluded by protocols used for clinical studies. As far as the majority of unconventional and paramedical treatments is concerned, naturopathy raises ethical beside scientific objections. Beyond a probable success of the treatment, it insists on a certain rationale and intellectual honesty. A differentiation between the more pragmatic interests of a health insurance and the scientific obligations of university medicine is given. An important and decisive criterium for the health insurances results from the demand for economics."

Naturopathic Management of Acute Pediatric Respiratory Infections: A Modified Delphi Study.,"Solomonian L, Blesoff J, Garofalo L, Lucas S, Picardo A, Garber A, Wilson M, Leach M.",J Integr Complement Med. 2023 Mar;29(3):181-195. doi: 10.1089/jicm.2022.0669. Epub 2023 Feb 24.,36827416,"Objective: Both the United Nations and the World Health Organization have identified antimicrobial resistance as a significant threat to global health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified five pediatric respiratory conditions as requiring particular scrutiny in terms of antibiotic stewardship. This study sought to identify strategies used by experienced naturopathic practitioners to treat acute respiratory infections in children. The authors theorize that naturopathic strategies safely fill the gap between watchful waiting and antibiotic prescription, thus reducing the use of antibiotics. Methods: Naturopathic practitioners in Canada, the United States, and Australia with a minimum of 5 years of experience in clinical naturopathic care of children were recruited for a modified Delphi study. A 14-person panel of practitioners was selected to complete a series of four iterative surveys assessing agreement to statements in five domains of knowledge/attitudes, assessment/diagnosis, management, monitoring, and education. Items were deemed to have reached consensus if they reached a predetermined threshold of 70% agreement, or failed to reach a threshold of 40% agreement. Items between these boundaries were modified and retested until either consensus was reached or the four surveys had been completed. Results: Results yielded a large degree of agreement on core naturopathic approaches to the management of acute pediatric respiratory infections, especially lifestyle strategies, including adequate rest and dietary recommendations. The use of vitamins C and D was strongly supported, as were herbs, particularly echinacea and elderberry. Some hydrotherapy and topical applications specific to the individual focus on infection also reached consensus. Results suggested that most respondents, even if they have the authority to prescribe antibiotics, rarely deem it necessary to do so. Conclusion: Findings of this study provide (1) clarity on the role of naturopathic doctors in the management of pediatric health concerns and the stewardship of antibiotics; and (2) initial guidance to less experienced naturopathic practitioners. The findings also identify key priorities for research into the safety and effectiveness of naturopathic interventions to reduce the unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics."

"[Naturopathy--definition, importance in the education of physicians and pharmacists].",Hartmann J.,Offentl Gesundheitswes. 1991 Dec;53 Suppl 3:264-7.,1840225,"Recent legislation on licenses for physicians and pharmacists prescribes the teaching of naturopathic methods. This requires a clear definition of the subject, which is given in different ways, all definitions leading to the same result. The essential effect of naturopathic methods is to activate sick persons, i.e. it is--in the strict sense of these words--rehabilitating and preventive. Patients who were instructed by their physician and other therapists can subsequently apply these methods autonomously. To teach naturopathy and its methods is likely to be a good means to help students to develop a better understanding of causality in medicine which, as a result of recent physical knowledge and theses, has become very complex and difficult to comprehend."

The aim of this non-representative pilot study on 139 women, who came for delivery to three institutions between mid-1997 and the beginning of 1998, was to receive data about how often and within which spectrum natural remedies are used during pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy 96% and within the lactation period 84% of the women consumed at least 1 natural remedy. Phytotherapeutic drugs were used most frequently. In contrast to the widespread use of natural remedies by pregnant women and nursing mothers in this study, little information on the effectiveness and possible risks is available. Therefore it seems necessary to examine and evaluate natural remedies used during pregnancy and lactation."

Epub 2016 Aug 24.,27575933,"The government of India has, over the past decade, implemented the ""integration"" of traditional, complementary and alternative medical (TCAM) practitioners, specifically practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy (collectively known by the acronym AYUSH), in government health services. A range of operational and ethical challenges has manifested during this process of large health system reform. We explored the practices and perceptions of health system actors, in relation to AYUSH providers' roles in government health services in three Indian states - Kerala, Meghalaya, and Delhi. Research methods included 196 in-depth interviews with a range of health policy and system actors and beneficiaries, between February and October 2012, and review of national, state, and district-level policy documents relating to AYUSH integration. The thematic 'framework' approach was applied to analyze data from the interviews, and systematic content analysis performed on policy documents. We found that the roles of AYUSH providers are frequently ambiguously stated and variably interpreted, in relation to various aspects of their practice, such as outpatient care, prescribing rights, emergency duties, obstetric services, night duties, and referrals across systems of medicine. Work sharing is variously interpreted by different health system actors as complementing allopathic practice with AYUSH practice, or allopathic practice, by AYUSH providers to supplement the work of allopathic practitioners. Interactions among AYUSH practitioners and their health system colleagues frequently take place in a context of partial information, preconceived notions, power imbalances, and mistrust. In some notable instances, collegial relationships and apt divisions of responsibilities are observed. Widespread normative ambivalence around the roles of AYUSH providers, complicated by the logistical constraints prevalent in poorly resourced systems, has the potential to undermine the therapeutic practices and motivation of AYUSH providers, as well as the overall efficiency and performance of integrated health services."

Bilateral dissecting aneurysms were found both at the level of atlanto-axial articulation and close to the origins of the vertebral arteries.

To the physician fell the role of the analytical observer who--according to the findings obtained - made a precise diagnosis which in consequence led to the adequate therapy. Patient and disease were the objects of observation and treatment. In the twentieth of our century a radical change took place. R. von Weizsäcker and R. Siebeck established the ""anthropologic medicine"" resp. the ""medicine of the person"" where the doctor and the patient enter into a personal relationship. The significance of the patient's biography in the course of this disease was recognized. The ""psychosomatic medicine"" was developed. Our own time requires the reorientation to those values and principles and, moreover, and improved integration of the advanced medical technology."

The primary aim of this research was to collect qualitative data from Australian Naturopathic practitioners about their clinical practices for CVD. Design: Semi-structured interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed, and ultimately coded by three independent researchers using the Framework Approach. Subjects: 10 Australian Naturopathic practitioners. Results: The key emergent themes from the responses of naturopathic practitioners embodied the elements of patient-centered care (PCC). Numerous factors, including regulation, barriers to service access, and interprofessional communication, were cited as hurdles to additional effectiveness as PCC practitioners. Conclusion: Future research should assess whether the principles of PCC are reported directly from the patients who utilize naturopathy for CVD to determine if their experience mirrors the reports by practitioners."

This study describes the spectrum of diagnoses and therapies observed in children treated in everyday anthroposophic practice.              Methods:                    Thirty-eight primary care physicians in Germany participated in this prospective, multicenter observational study on prescribing patterns. Prescriptions and diagnoses were reported for each consecutive patient. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with anthroposophic prescriptions.              Results:                    In 2005, a total of 57 893 prescriptions for 18 440 children under 12 years of age (48.1% female) were issued. In total, 50.3% of the prescriptions were classified as CAM remedies alone, 22.6% as conventional pharmaceuticals alone, and 27.1% as a combination of both. Anthroposophic remedies accounted for 41.8% of all medications prescribed. The odds ratio (OR) for receiving an anthroposophic remedy was significantly higher for the first consultation (OR= 1.19; confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.23). Anthroposophic remedies were prescribed most frequently for disorders of the conjunctiva (OR = 2.47; CI: 2.27-2.70), otitis media (OR = 1.50; CI: 1.43-1.59), acute upper respiratory tract infections (OR= 1.28; CI: 1.23-1.33), other respiratory diseases (OR= 1.15; CI: 1.07-1.24), digestive system and abdominal symptoms (OR= 1.39; CI: 1.28-1.51), general symptoms and signs (OR= 1.25; CI: 1.16-1.36), .and pneumonia (OR= 1.36; CI: 1.25-1.49). The likelihood of being prescribed an anthroposophic remedy decreased with patient age (OR= 0.96; CI: 0.95-0.96) and was lower in patients treated by a pediatrician (OR= 0.43; CI: 0.42-0.44). Of the 2475 therapeutic procedures prescribed (29% anthroposophic), the most frequent were physiotherapy, speech therapy, ergotherapy, and logopedics.              Conclusion:                    The present study is the first to provide a systematic overview of everyday anthroposophic medical practice in primary care for children. The findings show that practitioners of anthroposophic medicine take an integrative approach by combining conventional and anthroposophic treatments."

The application and value of information sources in clinical practice: an examination of the perspective of naturopaths.,"Steel A, Adams J.",Health Info Libr J. 2011 Jun;28(2):110-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2011.00929.x. Epub 2011 Mar 10.,21564494,"Background:                    The approach of evidence-based medicine (EBM), providing a paradigm to validate information sources and a process for critiquing their value, is an important platform for guiding practice. Researchers have explored the application and value of information sources in clinical practice with regard to a range of health professions; however, naturopathic practice has been overlooked.              Objectives:                    An exploratory study of naturopaths' perspectives of the application and value of information sources has been undertaken.              Methods:                    Semi-structured interviews with 12 naturopaths in current clinical practice, concerning the information sources used in clinical practice and their perceptions of these sources.              Results:                    Thematic analysis identified differences in the application of the variety of information sources used, depending upon the perceived validity. Internet databases were viewed as highly valid. Textbooks, formal education and interpersonal interactions were judged based upon a variety of factors, whilst validation of general internet sites and manufacturers information was required prior to use.              Conclusions:                    The findings of this study will provide preliminary aid to those responsible for supporting naturopaths' information use and access. In particular, it may assist publishers, medical librarians and professional associations in developing strategies to expand the clinically useful information sources available to naturopaths."

[Reference relationships between human and animal in Hildegard von Bingen].,Riethe P.,Sudhoffs Arch. 2012;96(1):39-63.,23155757,"In ""De animalibus"", the 7th book in the ""Liber simplicis medicinae"", Hildegard von Bingen describes the characteristics of four-footed land animals. Some of these have a special relationship with humans in that they embody moral qualities. An explanation for this is already given in the preface, which states that human intelligence recognizes these qualities, declaring that ""You are this or that sort of creature"". Since the relationship that animals have with nature shares a degree of similarity with that of man's, they can be regarded as symbolic representatives for particular human traits and characteristics. The article at hand presents Hildegard von Bingen's descriptions of the monkey, the lion, the bear, the rabbit, the dog, the cat, the wolf, the lynx, and the donkey. While the monkey just mimics man's behaviour and is imperfect in both settings, the lion embodies will power. The bear on the other hand stands for unbridled sexual desire, while in the rabbit the gentleness of a sheep is united with the bounce of a deer. The lynx is regarded as hedonistic, the donkey as stupid, and the wolf as surrounded by dangerous sylphs. In Hildegard's depictions, exotic and native animal species display rather extraordinary behavioural traits, and the medieval Christian world view of the author conveys unexpected relationships between humans and animals. In addition to empirical observation and experience, Hildegard also relies on folkloristic beliefs and magical practices related to explanatory models of her time. She allows largely unknown sources into her animal lore but never strays from her ultimate goal of having it serve to instruct people. In doing so, Hildegard removed herself far from the common tradition of medieval animal portraits."

[From Swiss herbs to the global plant system and individual use--a biographic approach to Alfred Vogel].,Melzer J.,Forsch Komplementarmed Klass Naturheilkd. 2003 Apr;10 Suppl 1:3-8. doi: 10.1159/000071677.,12808355,"Background:                    Even 100 years after the birth of Alfred Vogel there is a lack of reliable data about his life as a non-doctoral therapist in the fields of naturopathy and phytotherapy.              Objective:                    Which documents about A. Vogel do exist, which facts do they prove about his career and which interpretations of his point of view of phytotherapy do they allow.              Materials and methods:                    With the methods in medical history (heuristic, critic, interpretation) video, audio and written documents from the A. Vogel Museum and A. Vogel publisher in Teufen, the A. Vogel collection in the Museum in Aesch and the Bioforce AG in Roggwil have been examined.              Results:                    From 1923 to 1932 A. Vogel runs a grocer's shop or a herb and health-food store in Basel and later Bern, Zürich and Solothurn. The economic success of his health-food stores and his interest in the field of naturopathy enable him to take part in a training to become a 'natural doctor' and in 1933 he is registered by the 'Natural Doctors Association of Switzerland'. From 1935 on he is working as a nutritionalist in his own spa pension in Trogen and produces plant extracts in his 'Laboratory Bioforce'. From 1937 to 1957 he has a spa hotel in Teufen and is producer of extracts from fresh plants. He is able to travel all continents of the world from 1958 on, in order to observe customs and medical habits of different tribes. He writes about his findings in his own magazine and books. His knowledge about the usage of herbs in different cultures inspires his production of herbal extracts in his company. In 1963, to meet the increasing sales of his products, he founds the <<Bioforce AG>> where he, until the early 1990s, takes part in the adjustment of the recipes to the new pharmaceutic-medical standards.              Conclusion:                    Because of his work as a 'natural doctor' A. Vogel becomes one of Switzerland's best known non-doctoral therapists in the 20th century. The publication of his collected wisdom in a lay-like language is a contribution to the tradition and popularity in this field through which, as well as through the development of extracts from fresh plants, he becomes a promoter of phytotherapy."

[The admirable effects of panaceas: ideas between antiquity and early modern times].,Papadopoulos G.,Wurzbg Medizinhist Mitt. 2011;30:228-45.,22400194,"Panaceas, i. e. medicines that can cure many or almost all diseases, were used throughout the history from antiquity until modern times. The paper focuses on ideas developed to explain the admirable actions of these medicines. In antiquity such actions seem to be related to the large number of ingredients as well as to the presence of materials connected to potent poisons (e. g. viper flesh). Later, with the advent of alchemy, the alchemical preparation is regarded to produce medicines with such properties, the most pregnant example being lapis philosophorum. Such explanations are underpinned by the correspondences with higher astral influences as espoused by Paracelsus, as well as by van Helmont's idea that both disease and cure depend exclusively on the state of the 'spirit of life'. At the same time Galenic-like ideas survive, in the sense that panaceas are something like universal purifiers. Besides curing diseases panaceas were used to ensure long living, permanent health as well as for achieving rejuvenation. In this respect, they show an affinity to the so-called 'healing power of nature'."

In medical practise both concepts have always to be available concomitantly and and in equal rights, not only for repair of lesions but also for real healing."

These networks became visible in the form of double memberships in associations. However, there were also ambiguous affiliations, migration between groups and syncretistic beliefs without institutional belonging. The similarity between patterns of argumentation for this specific lifestyle and the congruence of chosen goals, ways and goods of salvation become particularly clear in this context. These forms of ""methodical lifestyle"" may lead to the development of a specific ethos or habitus (Max Weber). To illustrate these processes, this article analyses the report of a Leipzig lady who ate raw fruits and vegetables only, and examines her broader social context. Thereby the analysis will employ sociological theories of conversion to explain the case of Hedwig Bresch."

[Naturopathy as metaphor].,Nagel GA.,Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax. 1993 Jun 22;82(25-26):735-9.,8327814,"Scientific medicine criticises alternative, natural medical trends as being non-scientific, using untested means and being noncontributive to medical progress. As much to the point these arguments might be, as much they are defensive, since this criticism might extend to some questionable developments in scientific medicine. The term of natural medicine then stands also for the search for confidence and security, for the credence in natural self-healing and the wish of the ill for autonomy. Natural medicine also questions the rationale for the new directions in modern medicine. The actual movement of natural medicine is no longer the personification of an unconsidered, fundamentalistic rebellion from earlier times against the establishment of rational and technical science. It has integrated a constructive spiritual wisdom from modern ecology and expresses the concern that inner values, the moral and spiritual growth, do not keep pace with the apparent progress of feasible modern medicine. In this context a non-prejudiced and open discussion of these critical positions in our society could give an important role to the Academy of Lucerne 1991."

The popularity of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies presents new challenges. This article describes the current status of, and central issues in, efforts to create models for health care credentialing of chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, massage therapists, and other CAM practitioners. It also suggests a strategy of CAM provider credentialing for use by physicians, health care administrators, insurance companies, and national professional organizations. The credentialing debate reflects fundamental questions about who determines which providers and therapies will be accepted as safe, effective, appropriate, and reimbursable. More nationally uniform credentialing mechanisms are necessary to ensure high standards of care and more generalizable clinical research. However, the result of more uniform licensure and credentialing may be excessive standardization and a decrease in individualization of services. Thus, increased standardization of credentialing for CAM practitioners may alter CAM practice substantially. Furthermore, even credentialed providers can deliver ineffective therapy. The suggested framework balances the desire to protect the public from dangerous practices against the wish to grant patients access to reasonably safe and effective therapies."

Objective:                    To develop, refine and validate the Advancing Naturopathic Education and Practice (ADVANCER) framework.              Methods:                    Published literature and pertinent government, professional association and institutional websites were scoped to identify key constructs for the ADVANCER framework. The constructs were grouped into ten domains, with each domain defined and translated into teaching and clinical practice outcomes. A two-round e-Delphi method, comprising international experts in naturopathic medicine education, was used to refine and validate the framework definitions and outcomes.              Results:                    Sixteen academics, from five different countries, participated in the Delphi study. In round one, nine of the ten domains of the ADVANCER framework were rated as either very important or extremely important by 81.2% of participants. Only 68.8% of participants rated the tenth domain as either very important or extremely important. Participant feedback on each domain were pooled and reviewed, and where suggested changes were recommended by more than one participant, respective definitions and outcomes of each domain were amended. In round two, at least 90% of participants rated each domain of the amended ADVANCER framework as either very important or extremely important, meaning consensus to retain these domains, definitions and outcomes had been reached.              Conclusions:                    The study findings indicate that the ADVANCER framework is conceptually sound and potentially applicable to diverse institutions and countries. An important next step of this research is to establish whether implementation of the ADVANCER framework within naturopathic medicine education and practice is feasible, effective and sustainable."

Primary health care case management through the lens of complexity: an exploratory study of naturopathic practice using complexity science principles.,"Graham KD, Steel A, Wardle J.",BMC Complement Med Ther. 2022 Apr 15;22(1):107. doi: 10.1186/s12906-022-03585-2.,35428262,"Background:                    Advances in systems science creates an opportunity to bring a complexity perspective to health care practices and research. While medical knowledge has greatly progressed using a reductionist and mechanistic philosophy, this approach may be limited in its capacity to manage chronic and complex illness. With its holistic foundation, naturopathy is a primary health profession with a purported alignment with a complexity perspective. As such this pilot study aimed to investigate the application of complexity science principles, strategies, and tools to primary health care using naturopathy as a case study.              Methods:                    A network mapping and analysis of the naturopathic case management process was conducted. Mind maps were created by naturopathic practitioners to reflect their clinical conceptualisation of a common paper clinical case. These mind maps were inputed into Gephi, a network mapping, exploration, and analysis software. Various layouts of the data were produced, and these were analysed using exploratory data analysis and computational network analysis.              Results:                    Seven naturopathic practitioners participated in the study. In the combined network mapping, 133 unique elements and 399 links were identified. Obesity, the presenting issue in the case, was centrally located. Along with obesity, other keystone elements included: systemic inflammation, dysbiosis, diet, the liver, and mood. Each element was connected on average to 3.05 other elements, with a degree variation between one and 36. Six communities within the dataset were identified, comprising: the nervous system and mood, gastroinstetinal and dietary factors, systemic inflammation and obesity, the endocrine system and metabolism.              Conclusions:                    This pilot study demonstrates that it is feasible to apply a complexity science perspective to investigating primary health care case management. This supports a shift to viewing the human organism as a complex adaptive system within primary health care settings, with implications for health care practices that are more cognisant with the treatment of chronic and complex conditions and research opportunities to capture the complex clinical reasoning processes of practitioners."
Older adults' perspectives on naturopathic medicine's impact on healthy aging.,"Oberg EB, Thomas MS, McCarty M, Berg J, Burlingham B, Bradley R.",Explore (NY). 2014 Jan-Feb;10(1):34-43. doi: 10.1016/j.explore.2013.10.003. Epub 2013 Oct 17.,24439094,"Context:                    High rates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) utilization among older adults are of interest because studies suggest relationships among CAM, self-care, and healthy lifestyle. These potential relationships are of particular interest because of the contribution of self-care in maintaining physical, emotional, and spiritual health as key strategies to successful aging. Naturopathic medicine (NM) is a type of primary care CAM used by older adults, yet little is known about older adults' use of NM or its role in healthy aging.              Objectives:                    We sought to examine perceptions about, and utilization of, NM and the experience of addressing health and wellness as part of the aging process.              Design:                    Phenomenology-based qualitative inquiry.              Setting:                    A total of 13 community-based clinics affiliated with a naturopathic medical school.              Participants:                    A total of 47 adults aged 58-100 years.              Methods:                    Qualitative analysis of semi-structured focus groups with quantitative analysis of clinical administrative data.              Results:                    Over 2543 older adults used NM services affiliated with a natural academic clinic in Seattle in 2011 for diagnoses consistent with primary care: fatigue, anxiety, diabetes, diarrhea, and depression, in rank order. Participants reported they sought NM because it offered a different system of care aligned with their values. Themes included (1) feeling heard, (2) a focus on health education including prevention and self-care, and (3) feeling supported. Themes further distilled into optimal descriptive characteristics of patient-centered providers that may best support older adults' healthy aging. A final theme described barriers to further utilization."
Colloidal Silver Ingestion Associated with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis in an Adolescent Female.,"Mohan N, Gomez C, Khawar N, Narula P, John M.",Am J Case Rep. 2019 May 23;20:730-734. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.915499.,31118408,"BACKGROUND Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a disease of the small vessels and is uncommon in children. In this case report, we present an adolescent case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with the ingestion of colloidal silver, a naturopathic drug. This report highlights the rarity of the patient's presentation and inducing agent. CASE REPORT A 19-year-old female presented in the Emergency Department with severe rash on the face, and neck, and then continued to spread in a craniocaudal fashion during the day of presentation to involve trunk, back, upper and lower extremities. There was no recent travel, no pets and a negative family history for rheumatologic or autoimmune diseases. Her home medications included colloidal silver for ""internal cleansing"" for 4 weeks prior to Emergency Department presentation. Once the clinicians were aware of the continued ingestion of colloidal silver, the patient was advised to discontinue the drug. The patient was started on methylprednisolone with preliminary diagnosis of vasculitis, as well as concurrent therapy with colchicine. The rash was noted to be receding from the face within 24 hours. Over a hospital course of 5 days, the patient's rash and pruritus continued to slowly improve. CONCLUSIONS The ingestion of a naturopathic drug, colloidal silver, caused vast leukocytoclastic vasculitis in our patient warranting hospitalization due to the extent of the disease. The symptoms resolved after discontinuation of colloidal silver ingestion. Due to unknown safe ingestion concentrations and potential side effects, use of colloidal silver should be discouraged."

In Poland, 70% of the population complain of back pain and the prevalence rate increases with age. The treatment includes application of various procedures, both in outpatient conditions and in sanatoria. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of sanatorium treatment with those of outpatient treatment.              Material and methods:                    240 patients with low back pain participated in the study. The sample was divided into two groups: 120 pa-tients undergoing treated in outpatient conditions and next, 120 patients undergoing sanatorium treatment. The research was based on survey in a form of a questionnaire, selected mobility tests and assessment of pain using thermal imaging camera and an algometer.              Results:                    The patients undergoing rehabilitation procedures in a sanatorium obtain improvement in terms of pain sensation (5.39 points in VAS scale) as compared with the patients undergoing rehabilitation in outpatient conditions (4.13 points in VAS scale) ; their results also indicate improvement in low back mobility (the obtained values, however, turned out statistically insignificant). Better results can be obtained by combining conventional rehabilitation with the approaches applied in sanatorium treatment, as confirmed by the assessment of each group of patients.              Conclusions:                    1. Rehabilitation of patients with lumbar spine pain conditions conducted in spa conditions is a more effective treat-ment method than in an outpatient clinic and should be used universally. 2. Research is indicated to determine the effect of rest in a sanatorium (the ambience) involving low back pain relief."

Epub 2022 Jan 22.,35091269,"Background and purpose:                    Endometriosis is a painful female reproductive disease resulting in unmet health needs. Women with endometriosis frequently access different types of health care, yet little is known about naturopathic use. The purpose of this study is to explore the naturopathic utilisation by women with endometriosis in Australia.              Materials and methods:                    This study reports a cross-sectional survey of Australian women with endometriosis. Participants were recruited through the not-for-profit organisations Endometriosis Australia and EndoActive social media platforms. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire by those eligible to participate. Participants were included if they self-reported a diagnosis of endometriosis via laparoscopic surgery and were an Australian resident.              Results:                    Of the recruited 303 women with endometriosis, 60 women reported consulting with a naturopath for endometriosis care. Women consulting with a naturopath, reported also consulting with a laparoscopic surgeon (66.7%, p = 0.01), acupuncturist (53.3%, p ≤ 0.01), physiotherapist (41.7%, p = 0.01), nutritionists/dietitians (n = 22, 36.7%, p = 0.01) or homeopath (15.0%, p ≤ 0.001), in addition to their naturopath in the previous 12 months for endometriosis management. Compared to non-naturopathic users, women reported frequently experiencing dyspareunia (OR 2.9, CI 1.4-5.9, p = 0.002) and reported a higher use of vitamin D supplementation for endometriosis management (OR 4.9, CI 2.5-9.9, p ≤ 0.001).              Conclusion:                    Women who use naturopathy for endometriosis appear to be high users of health care services, both within complementary medicine and conventional medicine. The efficacy and role of naturopathic treatments and care for women with endometriosis requires further investigation."

Current Naturopathy to Combat Alzheimer's Disease.,"Chakrovorty A, Bhattacharjee B, Saxena A, Samadder A, Nandi S.",Curr Neuropharmacol. 2023;21(4):808-841. doi: 10.2174/1570159X20666220927121022.,36173068,"Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, which may ultimately involve cell death. The most common neurodegenerative disorder in the brain happens with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. It ultimately leads to neuronal death, thereby impairing the normal functionality of the central or peripheral nervous system. The onset and prevalence of AD involve heterogeneous etiology, either in terms of genetic predisposition, neurometabolomic malfunctioning, or lifestyle. The worldwide relevancies are estimated to be over 45 million people. The rapid increase in AD has led to a concomitant increase in the research work directed towards discovering a lucrative cure for AD. The neuropathology of AD comprises the deficiency in the availability of neurotransmitters and important neurotrophic factors in the brain, extracellular betaamyloid plaque depositions, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Current pharmaceutical interventions utilizing synthetic drugs have manifested resistance and toxicity problems. This has led to the quest for new pharmacotherapeutic candidates naturally prevalent in phytochemicals. This review aims to provide an elaborative description of promising Phyto component entities having activities against various potential AD targets. Therefore, naturopathy may combine with synthetic chemotherapeutics to longer the survival of the patients."

Empowerment in naturopathy: A qualitative analysis of practitioner perspectives.,"Taye I, Grace S, Bradbury J.",Complement Ther Clin Pract. 2022 Nov;49:101652. doi: 10.1016/j.ctcp.2022.101652. Epub 2022 Jul 31.,35932700,"Objective:                    This research aims to explore the role of empowerment in naturopathic consultations with patients with chronic pain.              Methods:                    Seven naturopaths were interviewed for up to 60 min online. A reflexive thematic analysis approach was used to code initial concepts. Through repeated immersion in the data, codes were clustered, refined and iteratively developed into overarching themes.              Results:                    Four major themes emerged from the data analysis: (i) establishing a therapeutic relationship, (ii) the therapeutic relationship as a mechanism for transformation, (iii) facilitating shared decision-making, and (iv) practitioner critical reflection. Participants identified that initial consultations were important for establishing rapport, identifying the causes of chronic pain, triggers of acute flare-ups and making sure the patient felt understood. Subsequent consultations focused on empowering patients through education, promotion of self-care and increasing self-awareness. Empowerment was manifest through all consultations by using active listening, education, and engagement with patients in a respectful manner that prioritised their treatment preferences in management plans.              Conclusions:                    The findings highlight the central role of empowerment in naturopathic consultations with patients with chronic pain. Patients were supported to become active agents in decisions about their health care, consistent with person-centred models of care. This in turn promoted patient empowerment. Critical self-reflection on the part of practitioners was integral to their empowering approach. The combination of patient empowerment and critical self-reflection suggest that a framework of empowerment may be useful for advancing our understanding of naturopathy practice in Australia."

At the very centre of this discourse was the idea of women as the weaker sex. Because of the paradigm shift in the history of medicine (due to the discovery of the cytopathology) the principle of a weaker sex seemed to be corroborated by scientific research, a fact which impacted on medical practice in many ways. ""Nervous"" disease evolved as the major threat ""of our times,"" with urban girls, young women and ""weak"" young men being most at risk. At the same time homoeopaths and naturopaths challenged modern medicine, offering alternative health practices, cures and drugs for people who could not afford the help of physicians or distrusted them. An analysis of several alternative medical guidebooks printed between c. 1870 and 1930 showed that homoeopaths and naturopaths shared the ""sexualization"" of medical discourse and practice only to an extent. On the one hand they believed that disorders such as hysteria, masturbation, chorea Sydenham and anaemia were nervous in nature and that the chances of curing them were poor. With the exception of masturbation these ""deadly"" threats were considered to be typically female. The general approach of alternative physicians, on the other hand, was unisex. The cures they offered to the public used unisex scales of constitutional characters. They even ignored the gender specificity of sick headaches. Gender-specific problems such as difficult deliveries and childbed fever were treated as ""natural"" and mild cures were favoured. The conclusion is that the influences of upper and middle class discourse on common health practices should not be overestimated."

The aim of this survey is to determine the outcome of this change by evaluating the current status of education of these three disciplines based on the experience and satisfaction reported by lecturers responsible for teaching these subjects to medical students. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey. A paper version of the questionnaire for each discipline was posted to each Medical University in Germany. The first part asked about the current status of teaching; the second part asked about facilities and requirements; the third part asked respondents to give information on their career and teaching experience in this subject Results: The response rate was 51.5% for Rehabilitation, 48.5% for Physical Medicine and 60.6% for Naturopathy. A vast range of people and faculties were involved in the curricula. The percentage of each discipline taught was unevenly distributed: the major proportion being rehabilitation (38%), then naturopathy 34% lastly physical medicine with less than a third (28%). The main delivery of these disciplines was through lectures in plenary sessions. Modern teaching methods were not in evidence. Lecturers were generally pleased to be working with the combination of the three disciplines. Conclusion: Future medical education should improve upon teaching coordination and aim towards a common curriculum for these three disciplines. Expected future changes to medical curricula will provide opportunities to improve the implementation of Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine and Naturopathy in teaching and research."

Rise in popularity of complementary and alternative medicine: reasons and consequences for vaccination.,Ernst E.,Vaccine. 2001 Oct 15;20 Suppl 1:S90-3; discussion S89. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(01)00290-0.,11587822,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become a popular form of healthcare and the predictions are that, it will increase further. The reasons for this level of popularity are highly diverse, and much of the motivation to turn to CAM pertains to a deeply felt criticism of mainstream medicine - many people (are led to) believe that conventional interventions, including immunisation, are associated with the potential to do more harm than good. Thus, it is hardly surprising that CAM also lends support to the ""anti-vaccination movement"". In particular, sections of the chiropractors, the (non-medically trained) homoeopaths and naturopaths tend to advise their clients against immunisation. The reasons for this attitude are complex and lie, at least in part in the early philosophies which form the basis of these professions. The negative attitude of some providers of CAM towards immunisation constitutes an important example of indirect risks associated with this form of healthcare. The best way forward, it seems, would be a campaign to clarify the risk-benefit profile of immunisations for both users and providers of CAM."

Development of an integrative patient history intake tool: a Delphi study.,"Lindahl MG, Barrett R, Peterson D, Zheng L, Nedrow A.",Altern Ther Health Med. 2005 Jan-Feb;11(1):52-6.,15712766,"Objective:                    To identify patient history intake questions common to four fields of medicine--allopathic, naturopathic, chiropractic, and Traditional Chinese Medicine for potential development of an Integrative Patient History Intake Tool.              Design:                    A two-round modified Delphi technique was utilized to generate expert consensus among Oregon healthcare practitioners on the importance of specific patient history intake questions. A panel of faculty members from Oregon Health & Sciences University (OHSU), the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM), the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM), and Western States Chiropractic College (WSCC) identified 321 patient history intake questions, which then were distributed to 106 Oregon healthcare practitioners. The healthcare practitioners were asked to rate the importance of each question through a series of two surveys over the period of 11 weeks. Suggestions for additional intake questions also were invited.              Results:                    The Delphi process resulted in the original 321 initial questions plus 150 additional suggested questions being reduced to 52 intake questions (11% total similarity) for the potential development of the Integrative Patient History Intake Tool. There was a 63% response rate to SURVEY I, and a 73% response rate for SURVEY II.              Conclusion:                    The concept of attempting to develop an integrative patient history intake tool is important to improve communication between practitioners of allopathic, naturopathic, chiropractic, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. This study revealed insight into the difficulties faced with such a tool due to the lack of similarity in priorities of questions between these different disciplines. This may also reveal a component of why communication remains difficult between these fields, but should not deter efforts to increase communication in the interest of optimal patient care."

Is adjunctive naturopathy associated with improved glycaemic control and a reduction in need for medications among type 2 Diabetes patients? A prospective cohort study from India.,"Bairy S, Kumar AM, Raju M, Achanta S, Naik B, Tripathy JP, Zachariah R.",BMC Complement Altern Med. 2016 Aug 17;16(1):290. doi: 10.1186/s12906-016-1264-0.,27534941,"Background:                    With an estimated 65 million Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients, India ranks second in the world in terms of DM burden. The emphasis of current medical practice has been on pharmacotherapy but, despite the best combination therapies, acheiving glycaemic control (reduction of blood sugar to desirable levels) is a challenge. 'Integrated Naturopathy and Yoga'(INY) is an alternative system of medicine that lays emphasis on the role of diet and physical exercise. We assessed the short term effect of INY as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy on glycaemic control among type 2 DM patients.              Methods:                    In this prospective cohort study with a 3 month follow-up, DM patients consecutively admitted to a hospital in India from May-October 2014 for either 15 or 30 days were offered INY - a package of vegetarian diet with no added oil, sugar and salt, yoga-based exercise, patient counselling and rest. A 'favourable outcome' was defined as glycaemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7 % or absolute reduction by 1 %) along with at least 50 % reduction in antidiabetes medication at 3 months relative to baseline. Compliance to diet was scored by self-report on a scale of 0-10 and categorized into poor (0-5), moderate (6-8) and excellent (9-10).              Results:                    Of 101 patients with 3-month follow-up data, 65(65 %) achieved a favourable outcome - with 19(19 %) stopping medication while sustaining glycemic control. Factors associated with favourable outcome were baseline HbA1c and compliance to diet, which showed a significant linear relationship with mean HbA1c reductions of 0.4 %, 1.1 % and 1.7 % in relation to poor, moderate and excellent dietary compliance respectively.              Conclusion:                    INY, adjunctive to pharmacotherapy, was associated with a significant beneficial effect on glycaemic control and reduced the overall need for antidiabetes medications. These early results are promising. Further studies with long-term follow-up and using more rigorous randomized controlled trial designs are needed."

Homeopathy was the most frequent therapy, followed by reflexology, naturopathy, and acupuncture. The most common medical complaint was pain, particularly back pain. The most frequent reason for consulting the practitioner was disappointment with the outcome of conventional treatment. 39% of respondents who visited a practitioner were being treated by a conventional physician at the same time, for the same problem. The medical problems of a large majority had been relieved, but 22% said they were not helped by the practitioner. Women were more likely than men to consult a practitioner. Respondents with secondary or higher education were more likely to visit than those with less education. There were no age or socio-economic differences between users and nonusers. The mean payment for the whole series of treatments was NIS 770 (about $250). Respondents who visited practitioners reported worse health and more pain than nonusers, and were also more likely to have visited their conventional primary care physician in the past month. The findings suggest that nonconventional medicine should be seen as complementary to, rather than in competition with conventional medicine."

Cautiously using natural medicine to treat liver problems.,"Xiong F, Guan YS.",World J Gastroenterol. 2017 May 21;23(19):3388-3395. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v23.i19.3388.,28596675,"Natural medicine is a system of therapy that administrates natural agents and their derivatives to treat human diseases. This medicine has been used to treat many kinds of human diseases for thousands of years. The treatment protocols of natural medicine are integrative in nature, and are required to utilize the most appropriate therapies to address the needs of the individual patient. Because of the relative convenience, safety and efficacy, natural medicine is now increasing worldwide. Naturopathic doctors are licensed in many areas of the world and regulated partly by law in these areas, which is quite different from various other forms of complementary and alternative medicine. Liver diseases, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver carcinoma, are serious health problems worldwide. Nearly half of the natural agents used in treatment of liver diseases today are natural products and their derivatives. Although natural medicine is beneficial and safe, physicians should pay close attention to the potential side-effects of the naturopathic agents, which lead to liver injury, interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Therefore, when administrating naturopathic protocols to patients for the treatment of liver diseases, we should try our best to prevent and avoid as much as possible the negative impact of these medicines. This article highlights the current practice and recommended improvement of natural medicines in the treatment of liver diseases and gives some specific examples to emphasize the prevention and management of adverse reactions of the natural agents and suggests that natural medicine should be cautiously used to treat liver problems."

Epub 2020 Mar 20.,32196980,"Aims:                    The current study sought to determine what factors inhibited psychologists, naturopaths and fitness instructors from detecting an eating disorder (ED), and the discipline differences across these factors.              Methods:                    Participants of the online study were 115 health practitioners who consisted of 35 psychologists, 50 naturopathic and 30 fitness practitioners. A vignette describing a female experiencing a sub-threshold bulimic variant without purging was presented alongside ED mental health literacy items such as assessing one's ability to detect a problem. Additional items examined factors that may inhibit detection, including practitioners' level of: thin-ideal internalization, orthorexia, health or fitness mindset (a newly developed scale measuring health and fitness obsessiveness) and gender role identity.              Results:                    A significant number of naturopaths and fitness instructors (20% and 33.3%, respectively) were found to have elevated orthorexia scores. Similarly, psychologists had the greatest tendency to internalize the thin-ideal (M = 3.60), which was comparable to levels seen in recent research for 20- to 21-year-old females with EDs. The two largest factors inhibiting ED detection were the strength of a health mindset and gender role identity. Practitioners who had higher health mindset scores or who associated with gender identities higher in masculinity traits (ie, either androgynous or masculine gender roles) were more likely to miss detecting an ED.              Conclusions:                    While many present ED studies focus upon assessing and changing client cognitions, this study emphasizes the need for further research regarding training interventions to address practitioner cognitions and gender role biases, which may in turn improve ED detection."

This can happen because cells react to extracellular stimuli by activating signal transduction pathways which result in activating the genetic program. Molecular biologists and cardiologists are tempted to evaluate these phenomena in respect to their potential meaning for a better understanding of the complex notions of health and disease. When molecular geneticists or cardiologists talk about autoprotective or natural defense mechanisms, and physicians talk about salutogenesis, they all mean something very specific. The phenomenon seen here belongs to the body's own defense mechanisms which make it capable of reacting to harmful influences and allow it to stabilize a structure and/or function of the body for a certain period. Here we see a connecting link to the historically grounded term self-healing forces, which has challenged medical doctors in the different historical periods of medical science. They tried to explain these effects based on the current model of the organism. Their understanding of this phenomenon played a role in defining the concept of health and disease. Thus, it seems very fitting to look back into history, since the phenomena discussed here as well as the insights into autoprotective mechanisms will continue to influence medical understanding of health and disease."

Epub 2023 May 22.,37217810,"Fibromyalgia syndrome is classified as a functional somatic syndrome. There are typical but not clearly defined symptom clusters, such as chronic widespread pain, non-restorative sleep, and a tendency to physical and/or mental exhaustion. The core principle of treatment in the S3 guidelines is a multimodal treatment, especially for severe forms of the disease. Complementary, naturopathic and integrative forms of treatment have an established place in the guidelines. Strong treatment recommendations with a high consensus exist for endurance, weight and functional training. Meditative forms of movement, such as yoga or qigong should also be used. In addition to a lack of physical activity, obesity is also accepted as an associated lifestyle factor and addressed in nutritional therapy and regulation therapy. The central aim is the activation and rediscovery of self-efficacy. Heat applications, such as warm baths/showers, saunas, infrared cabins or exercise in warm thermal water are in accordance with the guidelines. A current field of research is whole-body hyperthermia with water-filtered infrared A radiation. Other self-help strategies are dry brushing according to Kneipp or massaging with rosemary oil, mallow oil or the Aconite pain oil. Taking into account the patients preference, phytotherapeutic agents can also be used as herbal pain treatment (ash bark/trembling poplar bark/goldenrod herb), for sleep disorders in the form of sleep-inducing wraps (lavender heart compress) and internally (valerian, lavender oil capsules, lemon balm). Acupuncture treatment (either ear or body acupuncture) are accepted as part of a multimodal concept. The Clinic for Integrative Medicine and Naturopathy at the Hospital in Bamberg offers the three different formats of inpatient, day clinic and outpatient service covered by the health insurance."

Objective:                    The aim of our study was to investigate associations between chronic irritation of tonsils, abnormalities of the connective tissue areas over the musculus trapezius and the severity of brachialgia paresthetica nocturna.              Methods:                    Cross sectional study in 100 adult pain patients from an outpatient pain department. Patients with tonsillectomy were excluded. Examinations of tonsils and the connective tissue area were done separately by two mutually blinded physicians. Both were also blinded to the patients' evaluation of his/her brachialgia.              Results:                    Regardless of the lateralization, the severity of the tonsil irritations was correlated with the abnormalities of the connective tissue areas (Spearman's rho = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.87; p < 0.001) and the severity of the brachialgia (rho = 0.64, CI: 0.50-0.74; p < 0.001), furthermore indurations of connective tissue areas correlated with the severity of brachialgia homolaterally (rho = 0.57; CI: 0.42-0.69; p < 0.001). These correlations are considerably higher than those of other connective tissue areas.              Conclusions:                    The results support the existence of easy to diagnose reflex zones, at least in a highly selected population of pain patients. They can give plausible hints for naturopathic treatments of brachialgia paresthetica nocturna, i.e. treatment of the relevant connective tissue zone above the M. trapezius."

Yet, the activities of naturopathic practitioners (NPs) with regards to health promotion and community education have not been widely studied.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional online survey of an international convenience sample of NPs was conducted through disseminating a 15-item questionnaire prepared in five languages. Correlates of most frequently mentioned NP activities were studied.              Results:                    The survey was completed by 813 NPs representing all world regions. Almost all participants (98%) reported at least one health promotion activity. Most reported were information sheets and handouts (92.7%) or social and professional network communications (91.8%) and information talks presented to community members (84.9%). The majority of NPs (79.5%) indicated that the 'health issues individuals in NPs' community have said they need help with' were a 'very important' consideration when they designed health promotion activities. NP characteristics associated with the likelihood of engaging in specific health promotion activities varied between activities but include gender, time since first qualification, factors considered to identify need when designing an activity, and stakeholder involvement in activity design.              Conclusions:                    Health promotion is a key activity of the global naturopathic profession. There are a wide range of patient education tools utilized by NPs."

Naturopathic Management of Urinary Tract Infections: A Retrospective Chart Review.,"Garofalo L, Zwickey H, Bradley R, Hanes D.",J Altern Complement Med. 2021 Dec;27(12):1116-1123. doi: 10.1089/acm.2021.0163. Epub 2021 Aug 23.,34424727,"Introduction: Antibiotic overuse is a significant driver of bacterial resistance. Urinary tract infections (UTIs, cystitis) are the most common condition for which antibiotics are prescribed in the ambulatory setting. Many complementary and integrative approaches to cystitis have been proposed, including probiotics, D-mannose, and several herbal therapies. Trials comparing such therapies with placebo or antibiotics showed mixed, but promising, results. Naturopathy is a system of medicine that has potential to avoid antibiotic use for UTI because of its affinity for nonpharmacologic therapies and its theory that infection is a result of both the immune system's vulnerability and the pathogen's virulence. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of cases treated at four naturopathic clinics in the Portland, OR, metro area, where naturopathic doctors (NDs) have a scope of practice consistent with their license as primary care providers. The primary aim was to characterize how NDs treat UTIs in a real-world setting. Secondary aims were to gather preliminary evidence on the types of patient cases receiving such treatments, outcomes of treatments, and associations between presentation and treatment prescriptions. Results: The authors found 82 distinct treatment regimens among 103 individual patients diagnosed with UTI. Most patients received a combination of herbal medicine and behavioral modification (e.g., increase fluid intake), whereas the most common monotherapeutic regimen was antibiotics. Of the 43 patients who were followed up, 15 had no success with nonpharmacologic therapies and required antibiotics. The sample was comparable with national data regarding composition of public versus private insurance, acute versus recurrent/chronic UTI, and percent of cases related to uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Conclusions: NDs practicing in a primary care context frequently prescribe antibiotic and nonantibiotic multimodal therapy for uncomplicated UTI. These results may guide future studies testing complementary and integrative therapies for uncomplicated UTI."

Naturopathic Self-Treatment of an Atypical Fibroxanthoma: Lessons for Dermatologic Surgery.,"Worley B, Nemechek AJ, Stoler S, Cohen JL.",J Drugs Dermatol. 2018 Jun 1;17(6):683-685.,29879257,"Background:                    Alternative therapies are favored by some patients. In skin cancer, this may be to try to avoid surgery out of fear for the procedure and its functional or cosmetic consequences. Frequently, use of these therapies is not curative and can cause harm. Our objective is to detail a case where black salve was used as a natural remedy for an atypical fibroxanthoma and resulted in a severe burn. We highlight the challenges of communicating effective treatment options for those who have strong beliefs concerning natural remedies after a cancer diagnosis.              Case report:                    A 78-year-old man was referred for excision of a small atypical fibroxanthoma of the scalp. He had reservations about conventional treatments, he initially declined surgery. Later, he was found to have a severe burn over the site of the biopsy-proven AFX, extending to 20% of his scalp. He was found to have been applying black salve. Hospital admission and multiple stages of scalp reconstruction with Head and Neck Surgery were required.              Conclusion:                    For patients who desire to use alternative medicine, communication is all important. Integrative approaches to use traditional therapy while reconciling patient beliefs in natural medicine can improved oncologic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes.

Epub 2010 Nov 16.,21072601,"Background:                    The results of a survey of decision makers (directors of clinical departments, along with research and education institutes) at German medical schools in 1997 demonstrated that although most respondents were in favour of integrating complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into medical school curricula, only a minority had implemented these into their medical schools. The aims of this study were to evaluate the current opinions on CAM from decision makers at medical schools in three German-speaking countries and the present extent to which it has been integrated.              Methods:                    In 2004 we sent a standardised questionnaire to 1,017 department directors at medical schools in Austria (A, n = 75), Germany (G, n = 873) and Switzerland (CH, n = 69).              Results:                    487 questionnaires (overall response rate: 48%, country-specific response rate: A 39%; G 49%; S 42%) were returned. 40% of respondents had a positive opinion on CAM, whereas 28% had a neutral and 29% a negative opinion and 3% were unsure with a significant difference between Germany (44% positive opinion) in favour for CAM vs. Switzerland (22%; p = 0,021). The CAM therapies rated most positively were acupuncture (53%), osteopathy (52%) and naturopathy (38%) with no statistical differences between the countries. Naturopathy (39%) and herbal medicine (34%) were viewed more positively in Germany compared to Austria (4%, p = 0.001 and 8%, p = 0.01), but not to Switzerland (27%, p = 0.289 and 24%, p = 0.353). The majority of respondents favoured the integration of CAM into the medical system (research 85%, teaching 84% and treatment 60%). However, only 162 respondents (34%) indicated that CAM therapies had already been integrated into the curriculum at their medical schools (treatment 26%, research 19% and education 18%) with no significant differences between the countries. Respondents of Switzerland indicated lower activity of CAM integration (treatment 10% and research 10%) compared to Austria (28%, p = 0.016 and 28%, p = 0.016) and Germany (27%, p = 0.01 and 20%, p = 0.174).              Conclusions:                    The majority of respondents favoured the integration of CAM into the medical system. However, this integration remains limited and does not reflect the high usage of CAM in the population."

Design:                    Exploratory study combining quantitative and qualitative methods.              Setting:                    Southern Ontario.              Participants:                    A purposeful sample of 10 practitioners (five FPs and five NPs matched for age, sex, and number of years in practice): each agreed to recruit three consecutive patients with new complaints to participate in the study.              Main outcome measures:                    Patient and visit characteristics; qualitative (content analysis of audiotaped interactions) and quantitative (ie, patient-centred care scores) information was gathered and analyzed.              Results:                    Qualitative analysis revealed that information gathering and treatment planning were very similar whether patients were visiting FPs or NPs. Most important differences were length of interaction (mean 54 minutes for NPs and 16.5 minutes for FPs) and patients' reasons for visits. Naturopathic practitioners were more likely to recommend medications (usually natural health products) than FPs. Quantitative data suggested that patients perceived no differences in patient-centred care from FPs and NPs.              Conclusion:                    Overall, there were more similarities than differences in visits to the two types of practitioners."

Furthermore, it is unknown whether CAM use in the United States is associated with higher eczema prevalence. We sought to determine the eczema prevalence in association with CAM usage. We analyzed data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey that included a nationally representative sample of 9417 children ages 0 to 17 years. Overall, 46.9% (95% confidence interval, 45.6%-48.2%) of children in the United States used 1 or more CAM, of which 0.99% (0.28%-1.71%) used CAM specifically to treat their eczema, including herbal therapy (0.46%), vitamins (0.33%), Ayurveda (0.28%), naturopathy (0.24%), homeopathy (0.20%), and traditional healing (0.12%). Several CAMs used for other purposes were associated with increased eczema prevalence, including herbal therapy (survey logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.07 [1.40-3.06]), vitamins (1.45 [1.21-1.74]), homeopathic therapy (2.94 [1.43-6.00]), movement techniques (3.66 [1.62-8.30]), and diet (2.24 [1.10-4.58]), particularly vegan diet (2.53 [1.17-5.51]). In conclusion, multiple CAMs are commonly used for the treatment of eczema in US children. However, some CAMs may actually be harmful to the skin and be associated with higher eczema prevalence in the United States."

However, a series of landmark studies provided convincing evidence of role of this signaling in regulation of cancer development and progression. It is becoming progressively more understandable that loss or reduction of KISS1 expression in different human cancers correlates inversely with progression of tumor, metastasizing potential and survival. In this review we have attempted to provide an overview highlight of the most recent updates addressing metastasis- suppressing role of KISS1. We also summarize interplay of microRNA and KISS1 in cancer. The miRNA regulation of different genes is a rapidly expanding area of research however, the community lacks a deep understanding of miRNA regulation of KISS1. Recently, emerging laboratory findings have shown that KISS1 is transcriptionally controlled by TCF21 that is in turn regulated by miR-21. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further study of how miRNA directly or indirectly influences KISS1 at the posttranscriptional level. There is also a lack of evidence regarding natural agents that mediate upregulation or downregulation of KISS1. Increasing the knowledge of the KISS1/KISS1R signaling axis will be helpful in achieving personalized medicine."

Increasing trend toward reimbursement of herbal medicines by the insurance companies and managed care organizations have further encouraged their use. Because herbs are listed under the ""supplement"" category by the Food and Drug Administration, the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act establishes no protocol for standardization of the products labeled as ""supplements"" thereby increasing the risk for adverse effects associated with the use of these products. Moreover, there is little motivation for the manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded safety and efficacy trials on these drugs. Reports indicate that within the last 2 decades,more than 100 herbogenic deaths have occurred [100]. Many serious complications have been reported, including renal failure and need for renal or hepatic transplantation after taking nutraceuticals [101-107]. The anesthesiologists should have a detailed knowledge and understanding of the potential risks and purported benefits of herbal medicines and should thoroughly inquire about patient's use of herbal products [108- 11 ]. In addition,the education of each patient regarding the serious, potential drug-herb inter-actions should be a routine component of preoperative assessment. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), suggests that all herbal medications should be discontinued 2 to 3 weeks before an elective surgical procedure. If the patient is not sure of the contents of the herbal medicine, he or she should be urged to bring the container so that the anesthesiologist can review the contents of the herb or preparation. Although this idea holds some promise in the elective-care settings, anesthetic care in emergency settings should be based on a thorough drug-intake history from the patient or a relative, if possible.Unfortunately, the anesthesia literature has not addressed this new group of health supplements, despite many of these drugs having the potential to cause serious health problems and drug-herb interactions. There is a need to conduct additional scientific clinical trials to study the anesthetic responses to commonly used nutraceutical agents."

They allow evidence based decisions between individual therapeutical alternatives as well as decisions on health politics, e.g. concerning allocation of resources.              Patients and methods:                    A controlled prospective cohort study is presented. Conservatively treated patients were recruited for the study, if they needed in-patient treatment because of chronic back pain. The conservative orthopaedic treatment including Minimal invasive Therapy (MIT) was compared to in-patient naturopathic ""complex""-treatment. The real costs to the public health insurance system are unknown--relating to both the individual patient and the physician. Hence an approximation was attempted on the basis of the billing of the concerned hospitals, the analysis of extensive patient interviews, randomly selected evaluation of in- and out-patient records, validated by an expert panel.              Results:                    Costs for medication decreased in the post stationary phase after orthopedic and naturopathic treatment. Rehabilitation measures and treatments at a health resort increased after orthopedic treatment, whereas the frequency of specialist consultation decreased in both cohorts indicating the efficacy of the in-patient treatment. Incidence of psychotherapy was highest in the naturopathic group before admission to hospital and decreased afterwards. The gathered data point to a reduction of the total outpatient treatment costs in both cohorts. There were treatment-specific differences when regarding single components.              Conclusion:                    Naturopathic complex in-patient treatment is a cost-efficient complement of the conventional orthopedic treatment options."

Setting:                    The study was conducted by INYS medical research society in Jindal Nature Cure Institute, Bangalore.              Subjects:                    A total of 104 subjects, already diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension and on treatment with antihypertensive medicines were included in study.              Interventions:                    The intervention consisted of various inpatient administration of different naturopathy treatments, yoga therapies, low calorie and low sodium diet for 21 days. Antihypertensive medicines were withdrawn for some patients in one week based upon response to the treatment.              Outcome measures:                    The outcome measures were values of diastolic and systolic blood pressure and body weight. Subjects were followed for a period of one year after every 3 months.              Results:                    After starting nonpharmacological approach of naturopathy and yoga, Systolic blood pressure came down from mean of 139.6 to 129.6 where as it came down from 91.2 to 86.1 for diastolic blood pressure. At the same time favorable effect was also seen in other variables like lipid profile and body weight. At the end of one year out of 57 patients who came for follow-up, 14 cases were found to have blood pressure within normal ranges without any medication over the previous 12 months.              Conclusion:                    Naturopathy and yoga therapy can be considered as a valuable nonpharmacological approach in treatment of hypertension."

"A cross-sectional workforce survey of three traditional and complementary medicine professions in Ontario, Canada.","Ijaz N, Welsh S, Zhang Q, Brule D, Boon H.",PLoS One. 2021 May 13;16(5):e0250223. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0250223. eCollection 2021.,33983955,"Background:                    Workforce studies about traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) occupations in industrialized countries are scant; and, these occupations' position within the broader occupational workforce remains unclear. This study aims to address these gaps using a comparative approach.              Methods:                    Naturopaths, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) / acupuncture practitioners, and homeopaths in Ontario, Canada were surveyed regarding their demographics, practice characteristics and self-reported income. Results were compared with parallel data from within and outside of Ontario.              Results:                    Study response rate: 23.3% (n = 1205). While predominantly female (57.9%), Ontario's TCM/acupuncture profession was less feminized than the naturopathic (77.1%) and homeopathic (78.3%) groups. Naturopaths were significantly younger than, and reported fewer years of clinical experience than, the other two groups. About half of TCM/acupuncture practitioners, and almost one-third of homeopaths had trained outside of Canada, predominantly in East and South Asia, respectively. More TCM/acupuncture practitioners (58.9%) and homeopaths (57.6%) had multilingual clinical practices than naturopaths (19.1%). Homeopaths worked fewer hours and saw fewer patients per week than the other occupations. Self-reported mean incomes varied across groups, with naturopaths earning more on average ($63,834, SD $57,101) than did TCM/acupuncture practitioners ($45,624, SD $44,081) or homeopaths ($29,230, SD $41,645). Holding other variables constant, internationally-trained practitioners reported earning one-third less than their Canadian-trained counterparts.              Discussion & conclusions:                    Study findings echo occupationally-specific data from other industrialized jurisdictions; and, affirm that different T&CM occupations have distinctive demographic and practice characteristics. The demographic makeup of Ontario's TCM/acupuncture and homeopathy occupations suggests a role for these groups in delivering culturally-responsive care within Asian ethnic communities. T&CM practitioner incomes, in particular for internationally-trained practitioners, fell below the provincial population income median, and in many cases below the poverty line. T&CM occupations' relative socio-political marginality may be impacting clinicians' ability to earn a viable living."
[Unexpected loss of therapeutic effect of oxcarbazepine].,"Lampert ML, Rätz Bravo AE, Brugger S, Haschke M.",Praxis (Bern 1994). 2007 Nov 21;96(47):1843-8. doi: 10.1024/1661-8157.96.47.1843.,18062156,"After months of successful analgesic therapy with oxcarbazepine, a 52-year old woman with trigeminal neuralgia suddenly experienced episodes of heavy trigeminal attacks regularly in the evening at about the same time. Asked about changes in daily life or eating habits, she reported the ingestion of healing earth daily in the morning. After stopping the ingestion of healing earth, analgesic control of trigeminal neuralgia was restored without any changes of the initial pharmacotherapy. In daily practice, interactions which significantly influence the absorption of drugs are often overlooked. The documentation of these interactions in drug interaction databases, in the prescribing information, and in the literature is sparse though clinically relevant. Separating the ingestion of interacting substances by a time interval may not sufficiently avoid the interaction in every case. Particular caution is warranted when slow-release cation containing drugs or substances with entero-hepatic circulation are used."
Complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis: survey of licensed naturopaths.,"Shinto L, Calabrese C, Morris C, Sinsheimer S, Bourdette D.",J Altern Complement Med. 2004 Oct;10(5):891-7. doi: 10.1089/acm.2004.10.891.,15650479,"Objective:                    This paper describes the treatments and treatment outcome measures used by licensed naturopathic physicians in the United States who treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS).              Design:                    A cross-sectional mail survey was used.              Subjects:                    The participants were licensed naturopaths who were members of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians.              Outcome measures:                    Outcome measures included practitioner demographics; patient demographics by practitioner report; recommended therapies; perceived effectiveness of treatments for MS; methods for measuring treatment effectiveness.              Results:                    Forty three percent (43%) of the respondents (166/385) had treated at least one patient with MS while 56.9% (291/385) had never treated MS. 63.3% had treated 1-10 patients with MS, 19.9% had treated 11-20 patients with MS, and 16.8% had treated > or =20 patients with MS. Among the naturopaths, 68.1% communicated with an M.D. about their patient(s)' care and the majority of patients with MS were diagnosed by an M.D. (mean % = 96.3). The mean number of therapies recommended for M.S. was 3.91 (standard deviation [SD] =2.01, range 1-10). The most frequently recommended therapies included, diet (52.4%), essential fatty acid supplementation (44.6%), vitamin/mineral supplementation (33.7%), homeopathy (30.7%), botanicals (22.3%), and antioxidants (18.1%). Respondents perceived their treatments as ""very effective"" for the following stages of MS: early stage (57.2%); middle stage (25.3%); and late stage (3.0%). Respondents perceived their treatments as ""very effective"" for the following disease-related outcomes: improved quality of life (59.0%); decrease relapse rates (48.2%); decreased symptom severity (45.8%); prevention of disease progression (41.6%). The methods used ""most often"" for measuring treatment effectiveness included, patient report (88.0%); physical examination (27.1%); medical records/laboratory testing (13.3%). The mean estimated percentage of patients not taking conventional disease-modifying medication was 51.2% (SD = 42.7%).              Conclusions:                    Naturopaths use both a broad range and multiple complementary and alternative medicine CAM therapies for treating MS and report treatment effectiveness on the following outcomes: quality of life; symptom severity; relapse rates; and disease progression. Further research on single CAM therapies and holistic CAM systems is warranted in MS."

The Herdecke Questionnaire on Quality of Life (HLQ): validation of factorial structure and development of a short form within a naturopathy treated in-patient collective.,"Ostermann T, Büssing A, Beer AM, Matthiessen PF.",Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2005 Jul 8;3:40. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-3-40.,16004612,"Background:                    Quality of life (QoL) of patients has become a central evaluation parameter that also acts as an aid for decisions related to treatment strategies particularly for patients with chronic illnesses. In Germany, one of the newer instruments attempting to measure distinct QoL aspects is the ""Herdecke Questionnaire for Quality of Life"" (HLQ). In this study, we aimed to validate the HLQ with respect to its factorial structure, and to develop a short form. The validation has been carried out in relation to other questionnaires including the SF-36 Health Survey, the Mood-Scale Bf-S, the Giessen Physical Complaints Questionnaire GBB-24 and McGill's Pain Perception Scale SES.              Methods:                    Data for this study derived from a model project on the treatment of patients using naturopathy methods in Blankenstein Hospital, Hattingen. In total, 2,461 patients between the ages of 16 and 92 years (mean age: 58.0 +/- 13.4 years) were included in this study. Most of the patients (62%) suffered from rheumatic diseases. Factorial validation of the HLQ, it's reliability and external consistency analysis and the development of a short form were carried out using the SPSS software.              Results:                    Structural analysis of the HLQ-items pointed to a 6-factor model. The internal consistency of both the long and the short version is excellent (Cronbach's alpha is 0.935 for the HLQ-L and 0.862 for the HLQ-S). The highest reliability in the HLQ-L was obtained for the ""Initiative Power and Interest"" scale, the lowest for the 2-item scales ""Digestive Well-Being"" and the ""Physical Complaints"". However, the scales found by factor analysis herein were only in part congruent with the original 5-scale model which was approved a multitrait analysis approach. The new instrument shows good correlations with several scales of other relevant QoL instruments. The scales ""Initiative Power and Interest"", ""Social Interaction"", ""Mental Balance"", ""Motility"", ""Physical Complaints"", ""Digestive Well-Being"" sufficiently differentiate the diagnostic groups, particularly between the patients suffering on connective tissue and soft tissue disorders from those with metabolic and nutritional disorders or hypersensitivity reactions.              Conclusion:                    Both the factorial validation and the development of a consistent short-form of the HLQ are important steps forward for researchers in the field of QoL who wish to use the HLQ as a reliable and valid instrument. The results indicate that the HLQ is a unique QoL-instrument that can be used for both in-patient and out-patient-treatment. However, to improve to profile of the HLQ, there is still the need for strengthening the Questionnaire in the dimensions of physical well-being. This is the subject of a separate ongoing study."

Epub 2017 Feb 20.,28219100,"To ascertain the current development of the rehabilitation-related medical teaching in the interdisciplinary subject Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine, Naturopathic Treatment (Q12) regarding its execution, content, exams and evaluation of teaching at the Medical Faculties the German Society of Rehabilitation Science conducted another faculty survey in 2015. Representatives of all degree courses of human medicine in German Universities (n=41) received a pseudonymised standardised questionnaire in summer 2015. The response rate was 76% (n=31). Half of the faculties (48%) stated that they had a teaching and research unit for at least 1 of the 3 subjects of the interdisciplinary Q12. The Q12-teaching of faculties including these units partially differed from the other faculties. Model medical education programmes provide on average 2 semesters more for Q12-teaching in comparison to the traditional programmes. More than 3 quarters of the traditional programmes and all other courses include other medical professionals besides physicians as lecturers. Multiple choice questions still constitute the most common examination type (94%). Nearly all Medical Faculties evaluate the rehabilitation-related teaching but only half of all them have implemented a financial gratification based on the evaluation results. Even 10 years after the implementation of Q12, major variations were demonstrated regarding the execution, content and methods of medical education in rehabilitation. In the future the influence of the National Competence Based Catalogues of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education on the Q12-development and the Q12-teaching in medical university education in Germany with foreign qualification will be of particular interest."
Self-care dimensions of complementary and alternative medicine use among older adults.,"Votova K, Wister AV.",Gerontology. 2007;53(1):21-7. doi: 10.1159/000095681. Epub 2006 Sep 8.,16960457,"Background:                    There is a lack of understanding about the patterns and rates of CAM use among older adults owing to a lack of research on specific types of CAM.              Objectives:                    This study examines several dimensions of self-care deemed to be associated with CAM. Unmet health care needs, self-care attitudes, and spirituality are interpreted as health belief structures underlying CAM.              Methods:                    Logistic regression analysis was used to examine use of three groups of practitioner-based CAM: (a) chiropractic; (b) massage, and (c) acupuncture, homeopathy and/or naturopathy use. We analyze a subsample of 4,401 older adults drawn from the 1996/1997 and 1998/1999 waves of the Canadian National Population Health Survey.              Results:                    The logistic regression analyses indicate that self-care attitude and spirituality represent important predictors of practitioner-based CAM use. The associations for unmet health care needs were not supported. The strongest factors associated with CAM use were the illness context variables, which suggest that measures of need are key factors in leading individuals to seek other forms of health care.              Discussion:                    Practitioner-based CAM use among older adults is influenced by self-care attitude and spirituality, in addition to health status, but to varying degrees depending on the type of CAM. Support of these self-care facets suggests that there is a desire on the part of consumers to exercise choice and to participate in health care decisions when considering CAM."

Emerging issues associated with HIV patients seeking advice from health food stores.,"Mills E, Singh R, Kawasaki M, Bast L, Hart J, Majlesi A, Kiani P, Wilson K.",Can J Public Health. 2003 Sep-Oct;94(5):363-6. doi: 10.1007/BF03403563.,14577746,"Objectives:                    To ascertain the recommendations, training and education of health food store employees and determine how they communicate the costs, benefits and risks associated with natural health products for the HIV/AIDS community.              Methods:                    Four male research assistants, posing as asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals, inquired of employees of all retail health food stores in a major Canadian city as to what is recommended for their condition. The research assistants asked about product costs, side effects, potential drug interactions and efficacy. They also inquired as to employee education related to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and noted whether employees asked about which conventional medications they were taking and whether they recommended that the subjects seek physician or CAM provider advice.              Results:                    A total of 32 stores were included. Eight store employees (25%) offered no advice; eight (25%) inquired whether the subjects were currently taking medications; six (19%) suggested visiting a physician; and eight (25%) suggested visiting a CAM provider. A total of 36 different products (mean 2.3 per employee) were recommended with considerable variability in product evidence and cost. The education of the employees varied from postgraduate education (n=3), to undergraduate degree (n=3), college level (n=5) in CAM, or no formal education in CAM (n=21).              Conclusion:                    There was considerable heterogeneity in advice on natural food products provided by employees of natural food stores and, in general, these individuals had limited formal training in CAM. The products they recommended had limited evidence supporting their efficacy and in some instances were potentially harmful and had considerable costs. The findings of this study support the need to further examine how best to regulate this growing component of the health care system."
Classification of CAM use and its correlates in patients with early-stage breast cancer.,"Saquib J, Madlensky L, Kealey S, Saquib N, Natarajan L, Newman VA, Patterson RE, Pierce JP.",Integr Cancer Ther. 2011 Jun;10(2):138-47. doi: 10.1177/1534735410392578. Epub 2011 Mar 7.,21382963,"Hypothesis:                    Self-reported use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been shown to increase following a cancer diagnosis, and breast cancer survivors are the heaviest users among cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prevalence estimate of CAM use varied according to classification of CAM. The authors used a comprehensive system to classify CAM users and test differences in demographic, lifestyle, quality of life, and cancer characteristics among them.              Study design and methods:                    Participants were 2562 breast cancer survivors participating in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study, aged 28 to 74 years. A structured telephone interview assessed CAM use, questioning about specific CAM practices, and whether use was related to cancer. This study examined CAM use in relation to demographics, health behaviors, and quality of life.              Results:                    Approximately 80% of the women used CAM for general purposes but only 50% reported CAM use for cancer purposes. Visual imagery, spiritual healing, and meditation were the most frequently used practices for cancer purposes. CAM use, defined as consulting a CAM practitioner and regular use, was significantly related to younger age, higher education, increased fruit and vegetable intake, and lower body mass index (P < .05). CAM users who had seen a practitioner were also more likely to report poor physical and mental health than non-CAM users (P < .05). CAM use was not associated with changes in physical and mental health between study baseline and 1-year follow-up.              Conclusion:                    This study addressed important differences in the classification of CAM use among breast cancer survivors. Future studies need to further test the potential benefits and risks associated with CAM use."
Preventive screening of women who use complementary and alternative medicine providers.,"Downey L, Tyree PT, Lafferty WE.",J Womens Health (Larchmt). 2009 Aug;18(8):1133-43. doi: 10.1089/jwh.2008.1230.,19630554,"Background:                    Many women use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Although CAM use has been associated with reductions in conventionally recommended pediatric preventive care (e.g., vaccination), little is known about associations between CAM use and receipt of recommended preventive screening in women.              Methods:                    Using Washington State insurance data from 2000 to 2003, the authors generated clustered logistic regression models, examining associations between provider-based CAM use and receipt of screening tests for Chlamydia trachomatis, breast cancer, and cervical cancer: (1) contrasting women who used CAM providers only (alternative use) and women who used both conventional and CAM providers (complementary use) with women who used conventional care only and (2) testing associations between screening and use of four specific CAM provider types-naturopathic physicians, chiropractors, massage therapists, and acupuncturists.              Results:                    Both alternative and complementary use was associated with reduced Chlamydia screening. Cancer screening increased with complementary use but decreased with alternative use of CAM. Use of naturopathy was associated with decreased mammography, whereas all four CAM therapies were positively associated with Papanicolaou testing.              Conclusions:                    When used in conjunction with conventional care, use of provider-based CAM may signal high interest in various types of health-promoting behavior, including cancer screening. Negative associations between CAM and Chlamydia screening and between naturopathy and mammography require additional study. Interventions with CAM providers and their patients, aimed at improving rates of conventionally recommended screening, might encourage greater focus on preventive care, an important task when CAM providers serve as women's only contact with the healthcare system."

Design:                    A soy food frequency questionnaire, designed for use in this study, was administered twice to participants, separated by a 2-week interval. The questionnaire was tested for reproducibility of estimates of soy food consumption and isoflavone (genistein and daidzein) intake.              Subjects/setting:                    A convenience sample of 51 faculty, staff, and students was recruited from a naturopathic university.

Results:                    Correlation coefficients comparing mean soy food servings per month between the 2 administrations of the questionnaire ranged from 0.50 for soy yogurt to 0.89 for tempeh. Correlation coefficients for genistein and daidzein intake estimated by the 2 administrations of the questionnaire were the same: 0.89. Mean intake (+/- standard deviation) of genistein and daidzein was 7 +/- 10 and 4 +/- 6 mg/day, respectively. Fifteen soy foods contributed 95% of the total genistein and daidzein intake: tofu, soy yogurt, tempeh, soy milk, low-fat tofu, soy flour, miso, soy protein isolate, low-fat soy milk, veggie soy burger, textured vegetable protein, miso soup, cooked soybeans, soy hot dogs, and natto (fermented soy beans).              Applications:                    The soy food frequency questionnaire developed in this study provided highly reproducible estimates of soy food consumption and isoflavone intake. This instrument may be a useful tool in studies of the associations between isoflavone exposure and risk for chronic disease."

General practitioners using complementary and alternative medicine differ from general practitioners using conventional medicine in their view of the risks of electromagnetic fields: a postal survey from Germany.,"Kowall B, Breckenkamp J, Berg-Beckhoff G.",J Prim Care Community Health. 2015 Jan;6(1):21-8. doi: 10.1177/2150131914546332. Epub 2014 Aug 20.,25142575,"Objective:                    General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in consulting patients worried about health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). We compared GPs using conventional medicine (COM) with GPs using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) concerning their perception of EMF risks. Moreover, we assessed whether the kind of alternative medicine has an influence on the results.              Methods:                    A total of 2795 GPs drawn randomly from lists of German GPs were sent an either long or short self-administered postal questionnaire on EMF-related topics. Adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association of an education in alternative medicine with various aspects of perceiving EMF risks.              Results:                    Concern about EMF, misconceptions about EMF, and distrust toward scientific organizations are more prevalent in CAM-GPs. CAM-GPs more often falsely believed that mobile phone use can lead to head warming of more than 1°C (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-3.3), more often distrusted the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.4-3.6), were more often concerned about mobile phone base stations (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.6-3.6), more often attributed own health complaints to EMF (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.8-5.6), and more often reported at least 1 EMF consultation (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6-3.9). GPs using homeopathy perceived EMF as more risky than GPs using acupuncture or naturopathic treatment.              Conclusion:                    Concern about common EMF sources is highly prevalent among German GPs. CAM-GPs perceive stronger associations between EMF and health problems than COM-GPs. There is a need for evidence-based information about EMF risks for GPs and particularly for CAM-GPs. This is the precondition that GPs can inform patients about EMF and health in line with current scientific knowledge."
[Use of alternative medicine in oncology patients].,"Grothey A, Düppe J, Hasenburg A, Voigtmann R.",Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1998 Jul 31;123(31-32):923-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1024099.,9721567,"Background and objective:                    Up to 60% of all oncological patients use methods of alternative medicine in the course of their illness. In earlier blinded studies demographic characteristics and the patients' motives of using alternative medicine had been recorded, but a correlation with individual illnesses had not been possible.              Patients and methods:                    142 patients of a oncological outpatient clinic gave their experience with alternative medicine in interviews and non-blinded questionnaires, 103 of them (72.5%; 46 men and 57 women; median age 58 years, range 18-91 years) returning questionnaires that could be evaluated.              Results:                    46 patients stated that they had used alternative medicine. There was no difference between users and non-users regarding sex; age, profession, education, family status or religion. 58% of all patients with advanced disease used alternative medicine, compared with only 31% with partial remission or stable disease and 41% in complete remission (P = 0.042). Vitamins and mistletoe preparations were the most commonly used substances (50 and 45%, respectively). The predominant purpose was to stimulate the immune system (77%) and strengthen general physical capacity (64.5%). As main stimulus for using alternative medicine the patients came from their family doctor (56%), followed by family and friends (41%). Alternative medicine was used largely as complementary and not an alternative to conventional medicine. Health insurance met all or some of the costs of alternative treatment in 59% of patients.              Conclusion:                    A large number of patients treated with conventional oncological regimens also use alternative medicine, most of them because of a polypragmatic attitude to tumor treatment. Family doctors and health insurance companies are playing a more important role than had hitherto been assumed in spreading the use of treatment options without providing scientifically based evidence of their efficacy."
[Inpatient treatment for postradical neck pain syndrome by use of complementary medicine].,"Schencking M, Kraft K.",Forsch Komplementmed. 2010 Apr;17(2):81-6. doi: 10.1159/000287920. Epub 2010 Mar 5.,20484915,"Introduction:                    The standard treatment of papillary thyroid cancer with a diameter >1 cm is thyroidectomy combined with a modified neck-dissection of the central (perithyroideal, prelaryngeal and tracheo-esophageal) lymph nodes and a consecutive radiation. Frequently, postoperative pain syndromes occur after this procedure. The so-called 'postradical neck pain syndrome' (PRNS) is a combination of cervical neuropathic pain, constricted and painful mobility of the shoulder region(s) including inhibited abduction capacity of the shoulder joint and a scapula alata. PRNS is often resistant to conventional therapy such as analgesics and physiotherapy.              Case report:                    A 56-year-old female inpatient, suffering from a severe PRNS after thyroidectomy and neck dissection due to papillary thyroid cancer for the past 2 years, was treated with a combination of hydrotherapy according to Kneipp, conventional physiotherapy, acupuncture and cantharidin blisters in order to reduce neuropathic pain, increase the range of cervical mobility and improve parameters of health-related quality of life (based on SF-36).              Results:                    Within 4 weeks of combined treatment, the left-cervical neuropathic pain was improved remarkably, and the range of the cervical mobility was increased sufficiently. In addition, the SF-36 scales 'pain' and 'common well-being' were improved to a clinically relevant extent. The multi-modular treatment was well tolerated.              Conclusions:                    In PRNS, a combination of several methods of complementary medicine may be an effective and well tolerated alternative to conventional treatment. Further clinical studies are required to confirm the results."

Methods:                    A cross-sectional survey of naturopaths, nutritionists and Western herbal medicine practitioners was undertaken (n = 227) through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network.              Results:                    CIM practitioners (n = 36, response rate 15.9%) associate IP with gastrointestinal (100.0%), autoimmune (91.7%), skin (91.7%), neurological (80.6%), respiratory (55.6%) and liver-related conditions (44.4%). CIM practitioners frequently treat IP (72.7%); observing a minimum 3 months of treatment is required to resolve IP. Patient's signs and symptoms were the main reasons CIM practitioners suspected IP (94.1%).              Conclusion:                    CIM practitioners observe a clinical link between IP and a wide range of conditions, including those not yet recognised within the literature. The clinical experience of CIM practitioners holds substantial value to the advancement of research and the clinical management of IP."
Relying on nature's pharmacy in rural Burkina Faso: empirical evidence of the determinants of traditional medicine consumption.,Pouliot M.,Soc Sci Med. 2011 Nov;73(10):1498-507. doi: 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.037. Epub 2011 Sep 28.,21992735,"Traditional medicine is believed to constitute a crucial healthcare option for poor or remote households in developing countries that have limited access to allopathic medicine and/or a strong cultural attachment to traditional medicine. However, little research has been performed on medicinal plant reliance in developing countries, and the determinants of medicinal plant consumption at the household level in these countries have not been empirically studied. Quantifying the use of traditional medicine at the household level is, therefore, essential to the development of sustainable healthcare policies in the developing world. This paper quantifies household-level use of traditional medicine and identifies determinants of the choice of traditional treatment in the south central region of Burkina Faso. Structured household interviews (n = 205) were conducted in nine villages of rural Burkina Faso from November 2007 to November 2008 and in November 2009 to collect data on household characteristics (e.g., income, education, demographics), illness frequencies, illness types, and treatment strategies employed. Comprehensive analysis of treatment choice was performed through bivariate analyses. Results indicate that traditional medicine was primarily relied on by middle-aged individuals from relatively uneducated households who were living in villages with limited allopathic medicine service provision. Moreover, a differential approach to medicinal plant consumption was used to distinguish between patients using traditional medicine as a self-care treatment and those visiting a traditional healer. Although poorer households were shown to use traditional medicine as a self-treatment, traditional healers' services were relied on by wealthier households."

Methods:                    A cross sectional study was conducted involving 200 adults in two different settings-a community setting (n=100), and a hospital setting (n=100). A semi-structured questionnaire was used.              Results:                    Both in the community and in the hospital, siddha (80%) was the most well-known system of medicine, followed by Yoga (72%) and Naturopathy in the study population. However, the knowledge about the various available CAM therapies still seemed to be limited.              Conclusions:                    Opinion on the integrated approach along with conventional medicine was welcoming. Still more awareness about these systems is required to facilitate integrative medicine in healthcare settings."

The results showed reduction in weight (97.9 kg to 74.6 kg), Body Mass Index (BMI) (35.1 kg/m2 to 27.86 kg/m2), total cholesterol (192 mg% to 145 mg%), triglycerides (153 mg% to 90 mg%), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) (124 mg% to 81 mg%), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) (40 mg% to 46 mg%), fasting blood glucose (110 mg/dl to 75 mg/dl), postprandial glucose (267 mg/dl to 100 mg/dl), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (7.8%-7.1%), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (6.90 μIU/ml to 3.052 μIU/ml). Following the intervention, the anti-hypertensive, oral hypoglycemic, thyroid raising and analgesic medicines were not required to be continued. His knee pain minimized on discharge as observed on a Visual Analog Scale. He had an improved feeling of wellness and overall functional health. All his parameters were within normal range at the 12-weeks follow-up, as he had incorporated the lifestyle program into his daily routine. This case report suggests that lifestyle change by integration of specific non-drug Yoga and Naturopathic intervention is useful in the management of MetS."

Methods:                    Eighty patients were randomly assigned into a moxibustion group and a naturopathy group, 40 cases in each one. According to conditions,moxibustion was applied at the pain points of the terminal patellar tendon, Dubi (ST 35), Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Liangqiu (ST 34) and Xuehai (SP 10), etc., once a day and 30 min a time. Besides, exercise prescription was used, including ice compress, pull relaxation and targeted common strength exercise, etc. While in the naturopathy group, the microwave probe of inflammation therapy apparatus was aimed at the pain points of the terminal patellar tendon, once a day and 20 min a time. Also, the same exercise prescription was implemented as the moxibustion group. Seven treatments were taken as a course and 2 courses were required. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for knee joint pain and clinical effects were observed.              Results:                    After treatment, the VAS scores decreased compared with those before treatment in the two groups (both P<0.01),with more apparent one in the moxibustion group (P<0.05). The total effective rate of the moxibustion group was 97.5%(39/40), which was better than 82.5% (33/40) of the naturopathy group (P<0.05).              Conclusions:                    Moxibustion combined with exercise prescription can effectively improve the pain induced by patella tendinopathy of the athletes, which is better than inflammation therapy apparatus."

Methodology:                    This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among pharmacy students in four pharmacy schools located in Andhra Pradesh in South India. This study was conducted from the August to September 2014. The study population included all pharmacy students enrolled in Doctor of Pharmacy, Bachelor of Pharmacy and Diploma in Pharmacy programs in studied pharmacy schools. The pretested AYUSH survey had 8 questions on AYUSH related beliefs and 8 question on AYUSH related attitudes. The survey also asked participants about AYUSH related knowledge, frequency of use of AYUSH and the reason for using AYUSH. The data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were employed to study the association between the independent and dependent variables.              Results:                    A total of 428 pharmacy students participated in the survey. 32.2% of the study population was females and 32.5% of the population resided in rural areas. Males were more likely to have positive beliefs about AYUSH when compared to females (odd ratio [OR] = 4.62, confidence interval [CI] = 2.37-8.99, P < 0.001). Similarly, students living in hostels were more positive in their beliefs about AYUSH compared with students living at home (OR = 2.14, CI = 1.12-4.07, P < 0.05). Students living in hostel also had a positive attitude about AYUSH use (OR = 1.74, CI = 1.03-2.93, P < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    Pharmacy students held favorable attitude and beliefs about AYUSH use.

Due to the fact that hydropathic treatments were provided by nonmedical healers, discriminated as ""quacks"", there was continuous hostility between hydropathy/naturopathy and medicine. However, among the many establishments providing inhouse treatment for acute and chronic diseases over weeks there were some which were controlled by medical doctors in the 20th century and some which were implemented by government.

It has a significant impact on quality of life and societal expense. While there are pharmaceutical options available, few can be reliably recommended. Many IBS sufferers turn to complementary and alternative medicine including naturopathy. Naturopathic approaches to IBS are poorly studied to date.              Methods:                    We aim to describe naturopathic approaches to IBS as well as establish pilot data on before and after changes in validated IBS instruments. The study will employ a multi-centered, international, prospective, observational, naturalistic design. The uncontrolled before-and-after study will examine the outcomes associated with individualized, whole system naturopathic care as determined by each provider. We will recruit adult patients diagnosed with IBS and presenting to a participating naturopathic academic teaching clinic. Participants' IBS symptoms will be measured using validated instruments (IBS-SSS and IBS-AR). Quality of life will be measured by using the PROMIS-29 profile. Adverse events will be tracked, as followed for treatment descriptions. Our primary outcomes will be before-and-after differences using week twelve as the primary endpoint. A p values will be set at 0.05, and descriptive and summary data will be presented.

But they are not just medicines (or supposed medicines) offered and provided for the prevention and treatment of illness. They are also products and services - things offered for sale in the marketplace. Most discussion of the ethics of CAM has focused on bioethical issues - issues having to do with therapeutic value, and the relationship between patients and those purveyors of CAM. This article aims instead to consider CAM from the perspective of commercial ethics. That is, we consider the ethics not of prescribing or administering CAM (activities most closely associated with health professionals) but the ethics of selling CAM."

Epub 2022 Oct 17.,36311890,"Acupuncture is one of the most-utilized forms of integrative medicine therapy across the globe, owing to this modality's wide range of therapeutic benefits. The history of acupuncture use in India is 3000 years old; however, the first documented use of acupuncture in India emerged in 1959. Presently, acupuncture is included as an independent therapy in the yoga and naturopathy (Y&N) category, an indigenous system of medicine under the purview of the Ministry of Ayurveda, Y&N, Unani (Perso-Arabic Medicine), Sidha (Indian Medicine), and homeopathy (AYUSH), and Sowa-Rigpa (Tibetan Medicine), of the government of India. Acupuncture has been taught to Y&N medical graduates through state-run medical universities at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels since 1989 and 2014, respectively. In addition, there are many short-term courses on acupuncture offered by nonmedical universities and academies. Y&N physicians are licensed to practice acupuncture in many states of India; however it is practiced by physicians of other medical systems as well as by nonlicensed practitioners. This is largely due to the nonuniform and flawed regulatory framework of acupuncture practice in India. The government of India, through a task force, is exploring the possibility of recognizing acupuncture as an independent system of medicine and regulating its practice. While the status of acupuncture and its use among integrative medicine physicians has definitely grown in the past 5 decades, the challenges-rooting out quackery, ensuring rigorous training, empowering existing practitioners, maintaining global standards, defining the scope of practice, etc.-warrant an unbiased and firm approach to safeguard acupuncture's scientific and academic rigor."

Despite such demand, naturopathic practitioners are not well integrated into mainstream health systems, in part due to poor knowledge about naturopathy among policy makers and other health professionals. This study aims to describe naturopathic practitioners' practice behaviours and examine the characteristics that predict the use of naturopathic treatments and practices around the world.              Methods:                    An international cross-sectional online survey was distributed through World Naturopathic Federation membership organisations and social media accounts. Multivariate reverse stepwise logistic regression was undertaken to examine potential predictors of practice behaviours, adjusting for the influence of demographic and practice characteristics.              Results:                    A response rate of 78.4% was achieved (n=478). Lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, nutritional products and herbal medicines were most consistently prescribed Always or Most of the time. At least one-half of participants discussed nine of the ten health topics during clinical practice Always or Most of the time. More than one-half (55.1%) of participants practiced in a location with statutory regulation/occupational certification.

Complications from CAM are rarely the focus of regulatory bodies, or even the courts. Even regulated health professionals, who have profited by misrepresenting science-based evidence for treatment or prevention of disease, have been rarely sanctioned by their respective Boards or Colleges. This must change. In addition, there is a dire need for regulators, including the governments, who allow quack products and devices to be marketed in their respective countries, to prosecute them. Existing regulations must be coupled with more effective enforcement. Some of these cases have had a direct connection to me personally, while others are examples of just plain dangerous quackery."

Specific criteria are set out by governments to ascertain the degree of risk and the need for government intervention. A study was undertaken to understand the current state of usage and the practice of naturopathy and western herbal medicine, and to ascertain whether statutory regulation was warranted. We found increased use of these complementary therapies in the community, with risks arising from both the specific practices as well as consumers negotiating a parallel primary health care system. We also found highly variable standards of training, a myriad of professional associations, and a general failure of current systems of self-regulation to protect public health and safety. Statutory regulation was the preferred policy response for consumers, insurers, general practitioners, and most of the complementary therapists. While we found a case for statutory registration, we also argue that a minimalist regulatory response needs to be accompanied by other measures to educate the public, to improve the standards of practice, and to enhance our understanding of the interaction between complementary and mainstream health care."

The spirometric parameters [forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1, L), forced vital capacity (FVC, L), FEV1/FVC ratio (absolute value), maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF, L/s) and peak expiratory flow (PEF, L/s)] were measured by Helios 401 spirometer.              Results:                    Compared to baseline, post-intervention spirometric parameters showed significant (p<0.05) improvement in the FVC (82.40 ± 11.24 to 96.91 ± 18.76), FEV1 (86.13 ± 14.39 to 91.17 ± 12.48), FEV1/FVC ratio (86.96 ± 3.64 to 93.75 ± 4.80), MMEF 25-75% (86.96 ± 3.64 to 94.16 ± 11.57), peak expiratory flow rate (79.82 ± 14.90 to 92.18 ± 18.96).              Conclusions:                    Taking steam bath improves the spirometric parameters of healthy adult participants. However, future randomized controlled trials with on a large scale have to done to validate our findings."
Scope of Practice and Principles of Care of Naturopathic Medicine in North America: A Commentary.,Solomonian L.,Children (Basel). 2021 Dec 24;9(1):8. doi: 10.3390/children9010008.,35053632,"Naturopathic medicine is a growing profession in North America that provides expertise in complementary and alternative, or integrative care to pediatric patients. It is imperative that healthcare providers have an understanding of the training and scope of other health professionals in order to effectively make decisions regarding research, collaborative clinical care, and policy. Given the prevalence of use of complementary and alternative medicine by children and families in North America, and the growing interest in ""integrative"" medicine, we aim to offer an overview of naturopathic care for children. This document describes the principles, training, and scope of naturopathic medicine, including health promotion, disease prevention, and illness management. It describes the process by which naturopathic doctors create an integrative healthcare plan for children, evaluate and apply evidence, and integrate ethical issues in practice management, and speaks to the role naturopathic doctors have regarding advocacy for community and planetary health as it relates to pediatrics."

The Complementary Medicine Insurance Wars: The Unresolved but Politicised Australian Theatre of Combat.,Freckelton I.,J Law Med. 2019 Oct;27(1):7-19.,31682337,"Debates have taken place for many years internationally, including in Australia, about the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM). The issues raised in such disputation go beyond the capacity for patients to make choices informed by contemporary knowledge about the status of such disciplines and the accuracy of claims made by the various stakeholders. As government subsidises rebates under private health insurance for a number of modalities of health care, the entitlements of CAM disciplines to such rebates have become controversial. This editorial traces Australian reports since 2010 about the eligibility for insurance rebates of a number of CAM disciplines and calls for the current 2019-2020 review by the Chief Medical Officer to engage in a fair, rigorous and conclusive evaluative process, utilising as its yardstick contemporary evidence about treatment efficacy. Such a process has the potential to bring to an end disputation that has only served to confuse patient decision-making, cater to vested interests and incur for government costs that cannot properly be justified."

Because of the increased complications associated with the conventional medicine, the effects of naturopathic modalities were emphasized to prevent and minimize those adverse effects. This study was done to assess the immediate effect of neutral spinal compress on heart rate variability and blood pressure and thereby to substantiate the clinical understanding of its effect in hypertensive individuals.              Methods:                    Hundred hypertensive individuals were recruited for the study. Subjects were assessed for Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) before and immediately after the intervention of 20 min.              Results:                    Result shows significant reduction in mean Heart Rate (HR) (p<0.001), Low Frequency (LF) (p<0.001), Low Frequency/High Frequency (LF/HF) (p<0.001), Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001) and Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p<0.001) and significant increase in mean R-R interval (Mean RR) (p<0.001) and High frequency (HF) (p<0.001) components of Heart Rate Variability after neutral spinal compress intervention.              Conclusions:                    The results of the study reported that full neutral spinal compress reduces the sympathetic tone and shifts the Sympatho-vagal balance in favor of parasympathetic dominance and hence it can be concluded that neutral spinal compress can be effectively used in the management of hypertension.

Can a multimodal mind-body program enhance the treatment effects of physical activity in breast cancer survivors with chronic tumor-associated fatigue? A randomized controlled trial.,"Spahn G, Choi KE, Kennemann C, Lüdtke R, Franken U, Langhorst J, Paul A, Dobos GJ.",Integr Cancer Ther. 2013 Jul;12(4):291-300. doi: 10.1177/1534735413492727.,23766391,"Background. Chronic fatigue is one of the most restricting symptoms following primary breast cancer treatment, but clinical studies on symptom management are rare. The objective was to evaluate the impact of a multimodal mind-body program (MMMT), including moderate physical activity as compared with a walking intervention alone, on chronic fatigue symptoms of women with stage I to IIIA breast cancer.              Patients and methods:                    Sixty-four women (mean age = 56.7 years) suffering from chronic fatigue after active tumor treatment were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control (n = 32 each) intervention (10 weeks). Fatigue, quality of life (QoL), functional well-being, anxiety, and depression were measured with standard questionnaires at baseline, after 10 weeks, and after 3 months.              Results:                    Compared with baseline, both groups had reduced fatigue scores after treatment without any significant difference between groups (posttreatment, Δ = -0.3, confidence interval = -1.6 to 1.0, P = .678; follow-up, Δ = -0.4, confidence interval = -1.8 to 0.9, P = .510). All patients also improved regarding QoL and general functional well-being.              Conclusion:                    Since both interventions reduced fatigue symptoms and enhanced QoL to a similar extent, we observed no verifiable add-on effect of the MMMT regarding fatigue symptoms. Considering the higher costs with additional expenditure related to MMMT, home-based walking intervention is recommended."

Epub 2024 Apr 10.,38658284,"Whole-person care and holistic care approach has been proposed for complementary and integrative health care for type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some doubts still exist on the feasibility of replicating processes followed in clinical trials and observational studies in real-world settings. This narrative literature review summarized and assessed existing clinical evidence (clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports) describing holistic and integrated care approach in adult and adolescent individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus in clinical practice. The goal was to highlight existing evidence for implementation and outcomes of whole-medical systems and holistic integrated care approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A nonsystematic literature search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and ScienceDirect to identify clinical evidence from different parts of the world, evaluating the use of whole-medical systems and/or holistic care interventions in clinical practice for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Relevant keywords were used in the search. Data were analyzed using content analysis and simple descriptive statistics (percentages). Most of the studies (64%) were mainly conducted in Eastern countries (India, China and Israel) while 36% of the studies were conducted in the Western countries (USA, Netherlands, Canada and Mexico). Lifestyle medicine and integrated naturopathy were shown to be the commonly used whole-medical systems for type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Significant improvements in type 2 diabetes parameters, medication use, other symptoms, and overall feeling of wellness were observed in all studies. This review study revealed limited utilization and/or documentation of whole-medical systems or holistic care treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus in regions of the world other than eastern countries. Lifestyle medicine, naturopathy, yoga, Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine were shown to be effective for type 2 diabetes mellitus, either as an alternative or as a complementary therapy.

Clear guidance on safe and effective uses of infant massage is lacking especially in the contemporary times when the traditional knowledge is on the verge of extinction and preparations may differ from in the past. This paper presents a consensus guidance in the form of a standardized protocol for routine massage of infants in home settings. Furthermore, a feasible method to develop an integrative protocol involving traditional and modern medicine experts is described. A modified e-Delphi method was used to develop the protocol. A group of seventeen experts, including academicians and practitioners from disciplines as modern paediatrics, Ayurveda paediatrics, Physiotherapy and Naturopathy participated in three rounds of a Delphi study to evolve the consensus guidance. The present protocol for massage of infants born beyond 34 weeks of gestation and weighing above 1.8 kg is recommended for use by care givers. This provides guidance on the preparation for infant massage such as when to begin massaging the infant, checking fitness of the infant for massage, the appropriate time, environment, person and substance for infant massage and a detailed description of the procedure for infant massage. Paediatricians, obstetricians and other child care practitioners can use this protocol to guide care givers on how to peform infant massage."

The aim of this study was to measure how often naturopathic influencers make evidence-informed recommendations on Instagram, and to examine associations between the level of evidence available or presented, and user engagement. Methods: A retrospective observational study using quantitative content analysis on health-related claims made by naturopathic influencers with 30000 or more followers on Instagram was conducted. Linear regression was used to measure the association between health-related posts and the number of Likes, and Comments. Results: A total of 494 health claims were extracted from eight Instagram accounts, of which 242 (49.0%) were supported by evidence and 34 (6.9%) included a link to evidence supporting the claim. Three naturopathic influencers did not provide any evidence to support the health claims they made on Instagram. Posts with links to evidence had fewer Likes (B=-1343.9, 95% CI=-2424.4 to -263.4, X=-0.1, P=0.02) and fewer Comments (B=-82.0, 95% CI=-145.9 to -18.2, X=-0.2, P=0.01), compared to posts without links to evidence. The most common areas of health were claims relating to 'women's health' (n=94; 19.0%), and 'hair, nail and skin' (n=74; 15.0%). Conclusion: This study is one of the first to look at the evidence available to support health-related claims by naturopathic influencers on Instagram. Our findings indicate that around half of Instagram posts from popular naturopathic influencers with health claims are supported by high-quality evidence."
"Effect of bilateral needling at an acupuncture point, ST-36 (Zusanli) on blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: A pilot randomized placebo controlled trial.","Mooventhan A, Ningombam R, Nivethitha L.",J Complement Integr Med. 2020 Sep 23;17(3). doi: 10.1515/jcim-2019-0100.,32406384,"Background Diabetes mellitus is one of the major current public health problems. Electro-acupuncture at ST-36 showed a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels in diabetic rats. There are lacks of studies reporting its hypoglycemic effect in humans and thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of needling at ST-36 (Zusanli) on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Sixty T2DM participants were recruited and randomized into acupuncture group (n=30) and placebo control group (n=30). The participants of the acupuncture group received needling at ST-36 (one finger breadth lateral to the inferior border of the tibial tuberosity), and the participants those in the placebo control group received needling at placebo point (midpoint between the apex of the patella and tibial tuberosity). For both the groups, needles were retained for 30 min. Baseline and post-test assessments were performed prior to and after each intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16. Results The present study showed a significant reduction in random blood glucose levels in the acupuncture group compared to the placebo control group. Conclusion This study suggests that 30 min of bilateral acupuncture needling at ST-36 with manual stimulation is effective in reducing blood glucose levels in T2DM patients."
"Role of AYUSH workforce, therapeutics, and principles in health care delivery with special reference to National Rural Health Mission.",Samal J.,Ayu. 2015 Jan-Mar;36(1):5-8. doi: 10.4103/0974-8520.169010.,26730131,"Decades back AYUSH systems of medicine were limited to their own field with few exceptions in some states as health in India is a state issue. This took a reverse turn after the initiation of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005 which brought the concept of ""Mainstreaming of AYUSH and Revitalization of Local Health Traditions"" utilizing the untapped AYUSH workforces, therapeutics and principles for the management of community health problems. As on 31/03/2012 AYUSH facilities were co-located in 468 District Hospitals, 2483 Community Health Centers and 8520 Primary Health Centers in the country. Several therapeutics are currently in use and few drugs have been included in the ASHA drug kit to treat common ailments in the community. At the same time Government of India has recognized few principles and therapeutics of Ayurveda as modalities of intervention to some of the community health problems. These include Ksharasutra (medicine coated thread) therapy for ano-rectal surgeries and Rasayana Chikitsa (rejuvenative therapy) for senile degenerative disorders etc. Similarly respective principles and therapeutics can also be utilized from other systems of AYUSH such as Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy. Akin to Ayurveda these principles and therapeutics can also help in managing community health problems if appropriately implemented. This paper is a review on the role of AYUSH, as a system, in the delivery of health care in India with special reference to National Rural Health Mission."
Beyond genetics: integrative oncology and the metabolic perspective on cancer treatment.,"Mk Nair P, Silwal K, Ramalakshmi R, Devibala M, Saranya M, Sivaranjani S, Ramasamy T, Palanisamy A, Mahalingam M.",Front Oncol. 2024 Sep 18;14:1455022. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2024.1455022. eCollection 2024.,39376991,"Cancer is traditionally approached as a genetic disease, with standard treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery significantly improving survival rates and patient outcomes. However, there is a growing recognition of the need for integrative oncology, which expands cancer management by considering cancer as a metabolic disease. Integrative medicine physicians employ holistic therapies focused on patients' needs, aiming to correct the metabolic imbalances associated with cancer and alleviate cancer-related symptoms. Viewing cancer as a metabolic disease involves addressing factors such as an acidic microenvironment, vitamin C deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced intracellular oxygen levels, elevated oxidative stress, dysfunctional autophagy, and psychological stress. This paper presents an overview of the evidence and comprehensive strategies supporting integrative medicine approaches in addressing cancer metabolism in integrative oncology settings. Furthermore, the paper underscores the necessity of integrating different cancer theories-genetic and metabolic-for improved patient outcomes and experiences. By combining these perspectives, integrative oncology offers a more holistic, patient-centered approach to cancer treatment."
Long-term remission of type 2 diabetes through intense lifestyle modification program - A case series.,"Tripathi P, Kadam N, Vyawahare A, Kuppusamy M, Vijayakumar V.",J Family Med Prim Care. 2023 Sep;12(9):2168-2171. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2282_22. Epub 2023 Sep 30.,38024910,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission is being widely accepted and documented as feasible through calorie restriction and bariatric surgery. Recent studies with lifestyle changes have also shown T2D remission; however, long-term remission through lifestyle modifications is not yet established. Though glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a universally accepted indicator of glycemic status, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) would be a more robust marker in understanding whether the metabolic abnormalities in glucose metabolism have undergone complete remission as well. We present a case series of four patients enrolled in the Holistic Transformation Program, a lifestyle modification program, between 2016 and 2018. The intervention was a combination of a vegan diet, structured exercises, and stress management delivered over 12 months. All four patients successfully achieved T2D remission and cleared OGTT consecutively for a minimum period of 3 years. Our findings suggest that long-term T2D remission may be possible through lifestyle modification."
Less equal than others?

However, five years following the launch of the NRHM, the AYUSH mainstreaming scenario is below expectations, riddled with ethical and governance issues. Accounts from AYUSH practitioners at PHCs in various regions of the state of Andhra Pradesh reveal enormous lacunae in implementation: unfilled positions, inequitable emoluments, inadequate or absent infrastructure, assistance and supplies, unethical interpersonal arrangements, and limited support from non-AYUSH personnel. The widespread negative impact of these conditions undermines the value of AYUSH, demotivating both practitioners and patients, and failing to provide the intended support to the public health system."

Yoga has reported to be useful for neck pain and hot sand has reported to be useful for chronic rheumatism. The present study was conducted to evaluate the add-on effect of hot sand fomentation (HSF) to yoga on pain, disability, quality of sleep (QOS) and quality of life (QOL) of the patients with non-specific neck pain.              Materials and methods:                    A total of 60 subjects with non-specific or common neck pain were recruited and randomly divided into either study group or control group. Both the groups have received yoga and sesame seed oil (Sesamum Indicum L.) application. In addition to yoga and sesame seed oil, study group received HSF for 15 min per day for 5-days. Assessments were taken prior to and after the intervention.              Results:                    Results of the study showed a significant reduction in the scores of visual analogue scale for pain, neck disability index (NDI), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a significant increase in physical function, physical health, emotional problem, pain, and general health both in study and control groups. However, reductions in pain and NDI along with improvement in social functions were better in the study group as compared with control group.

Purpose:                    This cross-sectional analysis of the INCLD Health cohort aims to (1) evaluate the associations between perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and meditative practices with diurnal salivary free cortisol and (2) evaluate the associations of meditative practices as well as mind-body practices with perceived stress and sleep disturbance.              Methods:                    Serial multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle behaviours, were used to assess associations of (1) perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and meditative practices with salivary cortisol, and (2) meditative practices as well as mind-body practices with perceived stress and sleep disturbance. Meditative and mind-body practices were evaluated using a stress-management and self-care survey; perceived stress and sleep disturbance were evaluated using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the patient reported outcome measures information system-29 (PROMIS-29) sleep sub-score respectively. Salivary cortisol was collected at 4 time points over a 24-hour period and area under the curve (AUC) calculations conducted.              Results:                    82.5% (n = 80) of participants utilized at least monthly meditative practices. Greater disturbed sleep, but not perceived-stress, meditative, nor mind-body practices was independently associated with increased AUC cortisol (b = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.002-0.05, p = 0.03) after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and BMI. Neither meditative nor mind-body practices were associated with perceived stress or disturbed sleep.

Both prescription and natural health products (NHPs) have been implicated in DILI. There is a dearth of studies on NHPs induced liver injury.              Case presentation:                    A previously healthy 37-year-old female presented with subacute hepatitis, in the context of a previous admission to a separate institution, months prior for undiagnosed acute hepatitis. Importantly, she had disclosed taking complex regiments of natural health products (NHPs) for months. Her only other medication was rivaroxaban for her homozygous Factor V Leiden deficiency. She had an extensive work up for causes of acute and unresolving hepatitis. She discontinued several but not all of her NHPs after her initial presentation for acute hepatitis at the first institution and continued taking NHPs until shortly after admission to our institution. The predominant pathological features were that of drug induced liver injury, although an abnormal amount of copper was noted in the core liver biopsies. However, Wilson's disease was ruled out with normal serum ceruloplasmin and 24-urine copper. After 2 months of stopping all the NHPs, our patient improved significantly since discharge, although there is evidence of fibrosis on ultrasound at last available follow up.              Conclusion:                    NHPs are a well-established but poorly understood etiology of DILI. The situation is exacerbated by the unregulated and unpredictable nature of many of the potential hepatotoxic effects of these agents, especially in cases of multiple potential toxic agents. This highlights the importance of acquiring a clear history of all medications regardless of prescription status."

He was on 94 units of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents during his initial consultation visit. After obtaining informed consent, he was enrolled into intense lifestyle modification program for a duration of six months, with a three-year follow-up after the intervention. The patient underwent complete remission losing 13 kg of body weight and also successfully clearing oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) for three consecutive years. We present three unique features in the current case report: (1) Elderly age of the patient (2) OGTT clearance along with normalisation of HbA1c, and (3) High initial insulin dosage at baseline. A few of the common positive predictors of T2D remission documented in earlier studies include younger age and minimal or low doses of insulin. The current case study shows that older age and higher dosage of insulin, it is possible to undergo complete T2D remission along with OGTT clearance through intense holistic lifestyle modification. Future experimental studies with adequate sample sizes would help substantiate our observation."

Conclusion:                    A novel and feasible public health course for complementary and alternative medicine professionals on the public health principles for NCDs' prevention and control is needed to bridge the demand gap for public health professionals in India."
Current status of herbal drugs in India: an overview.,"Vaidya AD, Devasagayam TP.",J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2007 Jul;41(1):1-11. doi: 10.3164/jcbn.2007001.,18392106,"Herbal drugs constitute a major share of all the officially recognised systems of health in India viz. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy, except Allopathy. More than 70% of India's 1.1 billion population still use these non-allopathic systems of medicine. Currently, there is no separate category of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, as per the Indian Drugs Act. However, there is a vast experiential-evidence base for many of the natural drugs. This offers immense opportunities for Observational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology. Evidence-based herbals are widely used in the diverse systems and manufactured, as per the pharmacopoeial guidelines, by a well-organised industry. Significant basic and clinical research has been carried out on the medicinal plants and their formulations, with the state-of-the-art methods in a number of Institutes/Universities. There are some good examples. Indian medicinal plants also provide a rich source for antioxidants that are known to prevent/delay different diseased states. The antioxidant protection is observed at different levels. The medicinal plants also contain other beneficial compounds like ingredients for functional foods. Hence, the global knowledge about Ayurveda and Indian herbals will hopefully be enhanced by information on the evidence-base of these plants. This will yield rich dividends in the coming years."

Epub 2019 Apr 29.,31038350,"Objectives: This study aims to explore the treatment interventions complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) practitioners use in the management of an emerging health condition, increased intestinal permeability (IP), and the association these methods have on the observed time to resolve this condition. Design and setting: A cross-sectional survey of Australian naturopaths, nutritionists, and Western herbal medicine practitioners was undertaken (n = 227) through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network. Outcome measures: Frequencies and percentages of the treatment methods, including chi-square analysis to examine the associations between treatment methods and observed time to resolve IP. Results: Thirty-six CIM practitioners responded to the survey (response rate 15.9%). CIM practitioners were found to use a multimodal approach in the management of IP with 92.6% of respondents using three or more categories of treatment interventions (nutritional, herbal, dietary, and lifestyle) with a mean total of 43.0 ± 24.89 single treatment interventions frequently prescribed. The main treatments prescribed in the management of IP were zinc (85.2%), probiotics: multistrain (77.8%), vitamin D (75.0%), glutamine (73.1%), Curcuma longa (73.1%), and Saccharomyces boulardii (70.4%). CIM practitioners also advocate patients with IP to reduce alcohol (96.3%), gluten (85.2%), and dairy (75.0%) consumption. Evaluation of antibiotics (75.0%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (73.1%) prescriptions were frequently advised by CIM practitioners. A longer observed time to resolve IP was seen in CIM practitioners who did not reduce intense exercise in the management of IP (p = 0.02). Conclusions: This study represents the first survey of the treatments prescribed by CIM practitioners for IP and suggests that CIM practitioners use numerous integrative treatment methods for the management of IP. The treatment interventions frequently prescribed by CIM practitioners align with preclinical research, suggesting that CIM practitioners prescribe in accordance with the published literature. The findings of this study contribute to the implementation of clinical research in the management of IP, which considers multiple concurrent treatments."
Promoting health economic evaluation studies in the AYUSH system of medicine: the need of the hour.,"Muthappan S, Bagepally BS, Ponnaiah M.",Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2021 Aug 16;37(1):e82. doi: 10.1017/S0266462321000386.,34396945,"The double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases is a major threat to the Indian public health system. AYUSH, an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, represents the Indian system of medicine recognized by the Government of India. Mainstreaming of AYUSH is one of the key strategies of the Indian government for tackling increasing disease burden through initiatives such as AYUSH wellness centers, telemedicine, and quality control measures for medications in the AYUSH system of medicine. Such investment of resources in health systems may require economic evaluations. However, such evaluations are lacking in the AYUSH system, except for a few in homeopathy and yoga. In the absence of evidence from economic evaluations, researchers and decision makers are guided mostly by clinical efficacy while formulating healthcare strategies. In view of the increasing use of AYUSH across the country, economic evaluations of the AYUSH system are the need of the hour to aid healthcare decision making."
Autogenes Training - Qualitative Meta-Analyse kontrollierter klinischer Studien und Beziehungen zur Naturheilkunde.,"Stetter F, Kupper S.",Forsch Komplementarmed. 1998;5(5):211-223. doi: 10.1159/000021116.,9892818,"Autogenic Training - Qualitative Meta-Analysis of Controlled Clinical Studies and Relation to NaturopathyAutogenic training is a relaxation technique based on autosuggestions and practice in the perception of 'natural' relaxating processes of the body with an increasing calm basic attitude. The psycho-physiological changes that occur after periodical exercises can be explained by a plausible model which has been empirically proved in many of its aspects. With regard to methodological aspects the present study deals with the qualitative meta-analysis of 64 controlled clinical studies from 1952 to 1997. The clinical effect of autogenic training on the main symptoms as exclusive or at least central psychotherapeutic intervention (partly in combination with a somatic basic therapy) was evaluated. It was proved that autogenic training has positive effects on psychosomatic disorders (hypertension, asthma, intestinal diseases, 'vegetative dystonia', glaucoma, atopic eczema), on preparation for childbirth, sleep disorders and anxiety disorders. A positive effect can also be expected in case of headaches and Raynaud's disease, however, other relaxation techniques seem to be superior in these cases. Moreover, positive effects on the mood (e. g. depressive symptoms) and the general subjective condition (e. g. 'quality of life') have been proved by many studies. Hence indications can be derived according to the basic rules of evidence-based medicine. Nevertheless there are contraindications, for instance regarding exogenous, acute schizophrenic or affective psychosis. Beyond that the preparedness to therapy of many patients can be improved if the therapeutic offers are enlarged by autogenic training as a 'low level' offer. Autogenic training is an effective and useful component of preventive, rehabilitative or therapeutic interventions and can last but not least be part of therapeutic interventions which include naturopathy."
Mainstreaming AYUSH: an ethical analysis.,"Gopichandran V, Satish Kumar Ch.",Indian J Med Ethics. 2012 Oct-Dec;9(4):272-7. doi: 10.20529/IJME.2012.091.,23099604,"The National Rural Health Mission has stated as one of its key mandates the mainstreaming of the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems in order to help solve the human resource shortage in Indian healthcare. This has been planned at the primary level by providing training to AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programmes; at the secondary level by establishing departments of AYUSH in the district and taluka level hospitals; and at the tertiary level by establishing AYUSH centres of excellence as referral centres, and research, development and supervision points. The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in the basic philosophy of practice; disparities in approach to specific clinical conditions; differences in their normative approach in decision making; an unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing public health system can have certain ethical implications: not doing good by failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH; doing harm by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system; not disclosing which type of practitioners (AYUSH or allopathy) the patient is seeing; lack of proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots levels; and, finally, lack of social justice. These ethical issues have to be considered while mainstreaming AYUSH."
"Health-Related Quality of Life Outcomes With Regular Yoga and Heartfulness Meditation Practice: Results From a Multinational, Cross-sectional Study.","Thimmapuram J, Patel K, Madhusudhan DK, Deshpande S, Bouderlique E, Nicolai V, Rao R.",JMIR Form Res. 2022 May 17;6(5):e37876. doi: 10.2196/37876.,35470800,"Background:                    Although the benefits of yoga are well established across the world, there are limited studies exploring the long-term interrelation between yoga, meditation, and health. Specifically, there is limited research exploring the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among regular meditators and nonmeditators.              Objective:                    This study explored the differences in 7 domains of HRQOL (including quality of life, ability to adopt a healthy lifestyle, ability to relax, frequency of nervousness and stress, coping with day-to-day stress, workplace productivity, and staying healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic) among practitioners of yoga and meditation.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to all members who participated in a 100-day yoga and meditation program, culminating in the International Day of Yoga event, organized by the Heartfulness Institute in partnership with the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, Ministry of Ayush, SVYASA Yoga University, and Patanjali Yoga Institute, India. The program consisted of daily virtual yoga, meditation, and speaker sessions. The data were analyzed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.              Results:                    A total of 3164 participants from 39 countries completed the survey. Mean age was 33.8 (SD 13.6) years. The majority of the participants were female (n=1643, 52%) and students (n=1312, 41.5%). Regular yoga and meditation practice was associated with a positive impact on all 7 domains of HRQOL (Mann-Whitney P<.05 and χ2P<.05). Notably, experienced Heartfulness (≥2 years) meditators reported better outcomes in all the domains of HRQOL as compared to those not currently practicing this form of meditation and participants with ≤1 year of Heartfulness meditation experience (P<.05).              Conclusions:                    This is one of the first cross-sectional studies to explore HRQOL outcomes among participants of a 100-day virtual yoga and meditation program. Overall, a yoga and meditation practice was found to be an effective tool for promoting HRQOL. Regular yoga and meditation practice was associated with factors promoting health and well-being, with long-term meditation practice associated with increased benefits."

Epub 2008 Apr 10.,18496022,"Background:                    In the 'Klinik am Steigerwald' (Gerolzhofen, Germany), founded in 1996 and providing accommodation for 44 patients, European physicians apply methods of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).              Objective:                    To develop an assessment system which is suitable for the evaluation of therapies, can be integrated into daily routine, takes into account the particular therapeutic approach of the hospital, and promotes quality management.              Patients and methods:                    The hospital admits all kinds of patients with chronic and often therapy-resistant diseases. Patients are primarily treated with Chinese phytotherapy and acupuncture. Methods of classical naturopathy and Western medicine complete the therapeutic range. All admitted patients are to be assessed. Exclusions are made according to a previously determined set of criteria. A written consent is mandatory.              Results:                    The assessment system comprises 3 questionnaires; 2 to be filled in by the patients, and 1 to document the physician's evaluation of the therapeutic success, based on his final consultation of the patient. Between January 2000 and December 2004, 2,021 patients were admitted to the hospital and followed-up until 2006. Of these, 1,609 patients met the inclusion criteria; 1,282 of these, again, agreed to participate in the interviewing process. The questionnaires of 1,110 patients were eligible for analysis. The present paper describes the methods of assessment. Its results are to be published in a future paper.              Conclusion:                    Over the past 7 years, the assessment system has shown to be effective and appropriate to evaluate the type of therapy in question. It is intended to shorten the questionnaires."

Epub 2020 Nov 24.,33242770,"Aims:                    To enumerate and classify errors in physicians' orders of antiseizure medications (ASMs) to people with epilepsy presenting to neurology clinic.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study was conducted in the neurology clinic of a teaching hospital catering to a predominantly rural population. People in whom a diagnosis of epilepsy was confirmed and who presented for the first time with a prior prescription for antiseizure medication/s were included. Their immediate previous prescriptions were assessed for errors, enumerated and classified according to WHO guidelines for prescription writing.              Results:                    Hundred prescriptions of 334 patients screened were analyzed. The number of ASMs prescribed to a participant was 2 ± 0.6 (mean ± SD). We identified a mean of 5 ± 4 (median: 3; range: 1-7) errors in each order. These included superscription errors, e.g., missing information on seizure control and frequency (n = 90, 90%), generic name (n = 62, 62%), patient identifiers (n = 57, 57%), prescribers' identifiers (n = 29, 29%) and diagnosis or indication for prescribing the medication/s (n = 55, 55%). The most common inscription and subscription errors were dosing errors (22%) and pharmaceutical form errors (20%) followed by omission (13%), duplication (13%), substitution (12%), commission (9%) and frequency errors (8%). Errors were more common among prescriptions provided by primary-care and Ayurvedic, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) physicians compared to specialists (P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Errors are common among medication orders provided by non-specialist and specialist physicians. Primary care and AYUSH are more liable to make errors underscoring the need to educate them in basic epilepsy treatment."
Use of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in Patients with Malignant Diseases in High-Volume Cancer Center and Future Aspects.,"Kust D, Šamija I, Marić-Brozić J, Svetec B, Miletić M, Mamić G, Bolanča A, Kusić Z, Fröbe A.",Acta Clin Croat. 2016 Dec;55(4):585-592. doi: 10.20471/acc.2016.55.04.08.,29117649,"Usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is steadily increasing over the last decades, gaining medical, economic and sociological importance. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of complementary and alternative therapies in cancer patients. A cross-sectional, descriptive survey design was used to collect data through an anonymous questionnaire. A total of 267 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients in this study was 60.3%. It was found that 61 heterogeneous CAM therapies were used, the most popular among patients being naturopathy/folk medicine. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of CAM use were high income, divorced status, female sex and younger age. In conclusion, considering the fact that a large proportion of patients used at least one CAM approach, we need to continue our efforts to improve the patient-oncologist communication in order to deliver most reliable information to patients and to better understand the possible standard medicine-CAM interactions. According to results of the latest studies, CAM therapies that help manage pain, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, and other symptoms should be integrated into the patient overall care."

Pranayama is a part of yoga, which improves pulmonary function in combination of many pranayama, but the aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of only Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting on pulmonary function in healthy individuals.              Materials and methods:                    A total of 82 subjects were randomized into the study group (SG) (n = 41) and control group (CG) (n = 41). Baseline assessment was performed before intervention for both groups. SG practiced Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting for the duration of 10 min (5 min for each practice)/day for the period of 6 days/week for 2 weeks and CG did not practice so. After intervention post-assessment was performed for SG (n = 40) and CG (n = 39). Statistical analysis was performed by Independent samples t-test and Student's paired t-test with the use of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 (2007, USA).              Results:                    The result showed a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow (FEF)25% and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) along with a significant reduction in weight in SG compared with CG in independent samples t-test. Significant improvement in slow vital capacity (SVC), forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) along with PEF, FEF25% and MVV; Significant reduction in weight and body mass index were observed in SG unlike in CG in Student's paired t-test. No significant changes were found in forced vital capacity, FEV1 /SVC and FEF50% , between and within the group analysis of SG and CG.              Conclusion:                    Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting are effective in improving pulmonary function in healthy individuals."

Regulation of non-conventional therapies in Portugal: lessons learnt for strengthening human resources in health.,"Amaral P, Fronteira I.",Hum Resour Health. 2021 Sep 17;19(1):114. doi: 10.1186/s12960-021-00655-3.,34535172,"Background:                    The integration of non-conventional therapies (NCT) into health policies and health services delivery is a worldwide trend and might have a role in achieving Universal Health Coverage. WHO has encouraged countries to integrate NCT into health service delivery and to increase the interest and utilization by consumers. Following two resolutions by the European Parliament and by the Council of Europe, in the late 1990s, recommending the recognition of NCT and calling for EU legislation on non-conventional forms of medicine, Portugal initiated, in 2003, its path towards regulation of NCT. We analyze this process and discuss its implications and impacts in terms of health policies, health services delivery and overall health workforce.              Case presentation:                    The need to regulate NCT in Portugal stemmed from a growing demand for NCT (and acceptability) among lay citizens and a positive attitude among conventional health professionals which also advocated for a regulatory framework. Political efforts undertaken since 2003 allowed for important advances in the regulation of NCT, beneficiating safe professional practices, and ensuring future academic training at the highest standards, with the defining moment of the social and legal model transition occurring in 2013, when acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese Medicine were recognized and regulated. Nevertheless, and because the process knew important time gaps, significant deficiencies arose, mainly between regulation of the training and of the professional activities and the capacity to ensure the continuous production of NCT professionals at an acceptable rate and with minimum quality standards guaranteed.              Conclusions:                    The regulation of NCT in Portugal was lengthy but steady and was able to bring consumers a safer practice environment and NCT professionals a legal and deontological umbrella for their training, practice, and professional development. Nevertheless, and despite the growing acceptability and normative quality assurance of NCT and its workforce, the regulation process has highlighted some fragilities in terms of accessibility and availability that need attention and urgent action to achieve universal coverage."

Epub 2024 Mar 11.,38482512,"Background:                    Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly experience fatigue, discomfort, sleep problems, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Studies have shown that foot reflexology can help relieve these symptoms. The objective of this current study is to systematically review the effects of foot reflexology on patients with MS.              Methods:                    We conducted a systematic review of published literature in many databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, from January 1, 2000, to January 27, 2022. With language restrictions, we included randomized controlled trials of foot reflexology interventions for MS that had any clinical or psychological symptom measurements as outcomes. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess evidence quality. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Potential eligible articles were retrieved for full-text review. A third author checked for excluded records. All discrepancies were resolved through a discussion among the 4 reviewing authors.              Results:                    A total of 154 studies were identified; 9 studies with 545 MS patients were included in this review. The most frequently reported findings of foot reflexology intervention in individuals with MS were reductions in fatigue, pain, muscle spasms, stiffness, and psychological symptoms and improvement in bowel and bladder functions and quality of life.              Conclusions:                    The findings suggest that foot reflexology could be a safe and effective modality to reduce the physical and psychological symptoms and also improve the quality of life for individuals with MS; however, well-designed, large-scale trials are required to confirm the effect."

Epub 2023 Jan 4.,36619666,"Background and objective:                    In 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) was declared pandemic. Advancement in computational technology has provided rapid and cost-effective techniques to test the efficacy of newer therapeutic agents. This study evaluated some of the potent phytochemicals obtained from AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy)-listed medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2 proteins using computational techniques.              Materials and methods:                    The potential SARS-CoV-2 protein targets were utilized to study the ligand-protein binding characteristics. The bioactive agents were obtained from ashwagandha, liquorice, amla, neem, tinospora, pepper, and stevia. Ivermectin was utilized as a reference agent to compare its efficacy with phytochemicals.              Results:                    The computational analysis suggested that all the bioactive components from the selected plants possessed negative docking scores (ranging from -6.24 to -10.53). The phytoconstituents were well absorbed, distributed in the body except for the CNS, metabolized by liver enzymes, well cleared from the body, and well tolerated. The data suggest that AYUSH-recommended plants demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS CoV-2 virus infection with significantly reduced toxicity.              Conclusion:                    The phytoconstituents were found to hinder the early stages of infection, such as absorption and penetration, while ivermectin prevented the passage of genetic material from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Additional research involving living tissues and clinical trials are suggested to corroborate the computational findings."

Materials and methods:                    We used data of 18,832 participants from the cross-sectional Swiss Health Survey conducted by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office in 2017 and compared these data with those from 2012. We defined four CM categories: (1) traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture; (2) homeopathy; (3) herbal medicine; (4) other CM therapies (shiatsu, reflexology, osteopathy, Ayurveda, naturopathy, kinesiology, Feldenkrais, autogenic training, neural therapy, bioresonance therapy, anthroposophic medicine). Independent determinants of CM use and of conventional health care use were assessed using multivariate weighted logistic regression models.              Results:                    Prevalence of CM use significantly increased between 2012 and 2017 from 24.7% (95% CI: 23.9-25.4%) to 28.9% (95% CI: 28.1-29.7%), respectively, p<0.001). We identified the following independent specific determinants of CM use: gender, nationality, age, lifestyle and BMI. Female gender and nationality were the most specific determinants of CM use. Current smoking, being overweight and obesity were determinants of non-use of CM, while regular consumption of fruits and/or vegetables and regular physical activity were determinants of CM use.              Conclusion:                    Prevalence of CM use significantly increased in Switzerland from 2012 to 2017. Gender, nationality, age, lifestyle and BMI were independent specific determinants of CM use as compared to conventional health care use. Healthier lifestyle was associated with CM use, which may have potentially significant implications for public health and preventive medicine initiatives. The nationality of CM users underlines the role of culture in driving the choice to use CM but also raises the question of whether all populations have equal access to CM within a same country."

Epub 2013 Nov 25.,24332665,"Objective:                    Limited data are available about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) use in children attending otolaryngology services. We investigated the pattern of CAM use among children and adolescents attending a pediatric otolaryngology clinic.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional survey. Anonymous questionnaires were administered, prior to doctor's admission, to parents accompanying young patients attending the pediatric otolaryngology clinic. Parents were asked about their general attitude toward CAM and whether they had ever consulted or considered a consultation with a CAM therapist. Subsequently, CAM users were asked to provide details on CAM modalities used and on their overall satisfaction with CAM therapy.              Results:                    Of 308 questionnaires administered, 294 parents responded (95% response rate). Ninety-four parents (32%) reported considering CAM, or previous or current CAM use. Commonly used CAM treatments were acupuncture (44%), homeopathy (36%), and naturopathy (6.7%). CAM users assessed success rate as being: successful (37%), unsuccessful (24%) or undetermined (39%). Successful treatment was described in terms of cure, improvement and better awareness of the problem being addressed. In most cases parents stated that the primary physician was aware of CAM use by the child (74%).              Conclusions:                    CAM plays a substantial role among parents of children referred to pediatric otolaryngology consultation. The otolaryngologist awareness of parents' preference and interest may contribute to decision making regarding pediatric patients' management. Further investigations regarding CAM are warranted and clinical collaboration with CAM therapists should be considered."
"Association between complementary and alternative medicine use, preventive care practices, and use of conventional medical services among adults with diabetes.","Garrow D, Egede LE.",Diabetes Care. 2006 Jan;29(1):15-9. doi: 10.2337/diacare.29.01.06.dc05-1448.,16373889,"Objective:                    To assess the association between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, preventive care practices, and use of conventional medical services among adults with diabetes.              Research design and methods:                    We analyzed data on 2,474 adults with diabetes. We created an overall CAM-use category based on use of any of the following: diets, herbs, chiropractic care, yoga, relaxation, acupuncture, ayuverda, biofeedback, chelation, energy healing, Reiki therapy, hypnosis, massage, naturopathy, and homeopathy. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the effect of CAM use on preventive care practices (receipt of influenza and pneumonia vaccines) and use of conventional medical services (number of primary care and emergency department visits). STATA was used for statistical analysis to account for the complex survey design.              Results:                    A total of 48% of adults with diabetes used some form of CAM. CAM use was independently associated with receipt of pneumonia vaccination (odds ratio 1.56 [95% CI 1.26-1.94]) but not significantly associated with receipt of influenza vaccination (1.17 [0.92-1.48]). CAM use was independently associated with visiting the emergency department (1.34 [1.06-1.70]), having six or more primary care visits (1.44 [1.14-1.83]), and having eight or more primary care visits (1.66 [1.22-2.25]).              Conclusions:                    In contrast to the findings of previous studies, CAM use appears to be associated with increased likelihood of receipt of preventive care services and increased emergency department and primary care visits. CAM use may not be a barrier to use of conventional medical services in adults with diabetes."

Epub 2023 Oct 9.,38075182,"Bibliometric analysis is a standard method for evaluating the quality and quantity of published articles. AYUSH research portal (ARP) is meant for the dissemination of research findings in the domains of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy and allied faculties. The study attempts to understand the trend of published Ayurveda clinical trial-based articles in terms of quality and quantity. Three perspectives of research output assessed in this study are productivity in the field of Ayurveda, evidence from articles, and its involvement with the body system where disease or malfunctions are induced. Based on the study, it is observed that the highest number of articles have been published under the musculoskeletal, endocrine/metabolic/nutritional categories, and skin. Further, it is observed that only 4.50% of articles are categorized under the evidence of Grade ""A"" (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) as per the World Health Organization's traditional medicine research guidelines. Out of the top 20 journals which publish Ayurveda-based research works, only five journals are indexed in reputed indexing platforms viz., PubMed and Scopus. The findings indicate that, Ayurveda clinical trials have to be planned meticulously and carried out as per the RCT guidelines for producing quality evidence so that the abysmal percentage of grade-A category articles will increase in ARP. Further, the journals, which are not yet indexed in standard indexing platforms, must strive to secure a place in them to ensure access to appropriate peers and effective dissemination of findings."
Drug-induced headache: long-term results of stationary versus ambulatory withdrawal therapy.,"Suhr B, Evers S, Bauer B, Gralow I, Grotemeyer KH, Husstedt IW.",Cephalalgia. 1999 Jan;19(1):44-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2982.1999.1901044.x.,10099859,"Drug-induced headache is a well-known complication of the treatment of primary headache disorders, and its successful management is only possible by withdrawal therapy. However, it is unknown whether ambulatory or stationary withdrawal is the therapy preferred. We conducted a prospective study on the outcome of stationary versus ambulatory withdrawal therapy in patients with drug-induced headache according to the International Headache Society criteria. Out of 257 patients with the diagnosis of drug-induced headache during the study period, 101 patients (41 after ambulatory and 60 after stationary withdrawal therapy) could be followed up for 5.9 +/- 4.0 years. The total relapse rate after successful withdrawal therapy was 20.8% (14.6% after ambulatory and 25.0% after stationary withdrawal therapy, p < 0.2). The main risk factors for a relapse were male sex (OR = 3.9, CI = 1.3-11.6), intake of combined analgesic drugs (OR = 3.8, CI = 1.4-10.3), administration of naturopathy (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.2-29.3), and a trend to tension-type headache as the primary headache disorder (OR = 1.9, CI = 0.6-53.0). Our data suggest that neither the method of withdrawal therapy nor the kind of analgesic and other antimigraine drugs has a major impact on the long-term result after successful withdrawal therapy. Patients with risk factors according to our findings should be informed and monitored regularly, and combined drugs should be avoided. Furthermore, our data suggest that there is a need for research on individual psychological and behavioral risk factors for relapse after successful withdrawal therapy in drug-induced headache."
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): a review for the primary care physician.,Onopa J.,Hawaii Med J. 1999 Feb;58(2):9-19.,10098319,"It is difficult to find a satisfactory title for this review, because both the word ""complementary"" and ""alternative""-are not very politically correct currently. It is probable that there is no fully politically correct word, except for ""non-allopathic,"" which is unfamiliar to many MDs. Accurately used, the term ""allopathic"" is as opposed to ""homeopathic,"" so from its origins, ""allopathic medicine"" should include herbal medicine. However, in practice, herbal and many other non-homeopathic treatments are called ""non-allopathic,"" whereas conventional medicine is called ""allopathic."" ""Complementary"" usually would include practices that are used with conventional western medical treatments, and ""alternative"" would include those practices that are used instead of western medical treatments. For most of this review, the terms ""non-allopathic,"" ""alternative,"" and ""complementary"" could be used interchangeably. This topic has gained interest, and received some allopathic legitimacy, in part because of an article that David Eisenberg, M.D., published in the New England Journal.' In 1990, he performed a telephone survey of about 1,500 adults in the U.S. and asked them about the use of treatments and practices that were ""alternative,"" which he defined as not generally being taught in the U.S. medical schools and not being readily available in U.S. hospitals. From his sample, he extrapolated that in 1990, about 60 million Americans used alternative medical treatments, at an estimated cost of $13.7 billion. There were more visits to alternative healers than to primary care MDs that year, and over two-thirds of people who did use alternative medical treatments did not tell their doctors about it. Now that third party figures are becoming interested in paying for alternative medical practices (especially naturopathic, chiropractic, and acupuncture services), allopathic physicians will be increasing in the position of being able to refer people to alternative providers, and insurers will pay for services that MDs approve. Therefore, it will become increasingly important for physicians to have a degree of familiarity with alternative treatments (including efficacy and risks). So far, to date, there have been no cases of malpractice for giving advice about the use of alternative medical treatments, but liability will certainly exist to anyone who delivers treatments, such as acupuncture or spinal manipulation, in the event of an adverse effect. This review will briefly introduce some of the most common alternative practices likely to be seen in Hawaii communities: Homeopathy, Herbs, Naturopathy, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, and Chiropractic and spinal manipulation, and a brief discussion of Dr. Eisenberg's recent position paper on advising patients about alternative practices."
Use of non-orthodox and conventional health care in Great Britain.,"Thomas KJ, Carr J, Westlake L, Williams BT.",BMJ. 1991 Jan 26;302(6770):207-10. doi: 10.1136/bmj.302.6770.207.,1998760,"Objective:                    To describe the characteristics of patients using non-orthodox health care and their pattern of use of conventional health care with respect to a particular problem.              Design:                    Postal survey of all 2152 practitioners of acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, and osteopathy identified from 11 national professional association registers. Patients attending a representative sample of 101 responding practitioners completed questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, presenting problems, and use of the health service.              Setting:                    Practices of practitioners of non-orthodox health care in England, Scotland, and Wales.              Subjects:                    Qualified, non-medical practitioners of non-orthodox health care working in Great Britain and 2473 patients who had attended one of the sampled practitioners in an allocated time period between August 1987 and July 1988.              Results:                    An estimated 1909 practitioners were actively practising one of the study treatments in Great Britain in 1987. Of the estimated 70,600 patients seen by this group of practitioners in an average week, most (78%) were attending with a musculoskeletal problem. Two thirds of the patients were women. Only 2% were aged under 16, but 15% were aged 65 or over. One in three patients had not received previous conventional care for their main problem; 18% were receiving concurrent non-orthodox and conventional care. Twenty two per cent of the patients reported having seen their general practitioner for any reason in the two weeks before the surveyed consultation.              Conclusions:                    Patients of non-orthodox health care, as provided by this group of practitioners, had not turned their backs on conventional health care. Non-orthodox treatment was sought for a limited range of problems and used most frequently as a supplement to orthodox medicine."
Complementary and alternative medicine for pediatric otitis media.,"Levi JR, Brody RM, McKee-Cole K, Pribitkin E, O'Reilly R.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2013 Jun;77(6):926-31. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.03.009. Epub 2013 Apr 4.,23562352,"Objective:                    To review the literature involving complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for pediatric otitis media. Multiple modalities are discussed, including prevention involving breastfeeding, nutrition, and vaccination; symptomatic treatment involving homeopathy, natural health products, and probiotics; manual manipulations involving osteopathy and chiropractics; and traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. The information presented will assist physicians in advising patients on their decision-making during the early stages of otitis media when antibiotics and surgery are not yet indicated.              Methods:                    A systematic literature search was conducted through January 2012 in PubMed using MESH term ""otitis media"" in conjunction with ""complementary therapies,"" ""homeopathy,"" ""manipulation, osteopathic,"" ""manipulation, chiropractic,"" ""acupuncture therapy,"" ""probiotics,"" ""naturopathy,"" and ""xylitol."" Theses searches yielded 163 unique results. Abstracts and titles were evaluated for relevance. Case reports, case series, randomized controlled trials, and basic science research were included. Publications not relevant to the discussion of alternative medicine in otitis media were excluded. Bibliographies were checked for further publications. Thirty-six unique publications were reviewed.              Results:                    Of all therapies in complementary and alternative medicine, only xylitol has been studied in well-designed, randomized, blinded trials; it is likely effective, but compliance limits its applicability.              Conclusions:                    Management of acute otitis media begins with watchful waiting. Herbal eardrops may help relieve symptoms. Homeopathic treatments may help decrease pain and lead to faster resolution. Prevention should be emphasized with elimination of risk factors, such as second hand smoke and bottle-feeding, as well as maintaining nutrition and vaccinations. Vitamin supplementation may be helpful. Probiotics and xylitol may be beneficial as well. Traditional Chinese/Japanese therapies show promising results but remain speculative until further research is conducted. Severe cases of otitis media with complications or those that fail to improve with observation or CAM (after 48-72h) should be treated with antibiotics and, in some cases, surgical intervention. It is best to consult a physician when making treatment decisions for full guidance on the risks and benefits of any treatment option."

Immunomodulatory protein from ganoderma microsporum protects against oxidative damages and cognitive impairments after traumatic brain injury.,"Chao MW, Liao CW, Lin CH, Tseng CY.",Mol Cell Neurosci. 2022 May;120:103735. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2022.103735. Epub 2022 May 11.,35562037,"A traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes abnormal proliferation of neuroglial cells, and over-release of glutamate induces oxidative stress and inflammation and leads to neuronal death, memory deficits, and even death if the condition is severe. There is currently no effective treatment for TBI. Recent interests have focused on the benefits of supplements or natural products like Ganoderma. Studies have indicated that immunomodulatory protein from Ganoderma microsporum (GMI) inhibits oxidative stress in lung cancer cells A549 and induces cancer cell death by causing intracellular autophagy. However, no evidence has shown the application of GMI on TBI. Thus, this study addressed whether GMI could be used to prevent or treat TBI through its anti-inflammation and antioxidative effects. We used glutamate-induced excitotoxicity as in vitro model and penetrating brain injury as in vivo model of TBI. We found that GMI inhibits the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and reduces neuronal death in cortical neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity. In neurite injury assay, GMI promotes neurite regeneration, the length of the regenerated neurite was even longer than that of the control group. The animal data show that GMI alleviates TBI-induced spatial memory deficits, expedites the restoration of the injured areas, induces the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, increases the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) and lowers the astroglial proliferation. It is the first paper to apply GMI to brain-injured diseases and confirms that GMI reduces oxidative stress caused by TBI and improves neurocognitive function. Moreover, the effects show that prevention is better than treatment. Thus, this study provides a potential treatment in naturopathy against TBI."

Methods:                    The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted as a sub study of the Pan India trial Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharath (NMB). The cohort was identified through the Indian Diabetes Risk Scoring (IDRS) (≥ 60) and a total of 184 individuals were randomized into intervention (n = 91) and control groups (n = 93). The DYP group underwent the specific DYP training whereas the control group followed their daily regimen. The study outcomes included changes in glycemic and lipid profile. Analysis was done under intent-to-treat principle.              Results:                    The 3 months DYP practice showed diverse results showing glycemic and lipid profile of the high risk individuals. Three months of DYP intervention was found to significantly reduce the levels of post-prandial glucose levels (p = 0.035) and LDL-c levels (p = 0.014) and waist circumference (P = 0.001).              Conclusion:                    The findings indicate that the DYP intervention could improve the metabolic status of the high-diabetes-risk individuals with respect to their glucose tolerance and lipid levels, partially explained by the reduction in abdominal obesity.

Epub 2024 Mar 21.,38514899,"Background:                    Women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) have fewer eggs than would be expected at their age. It is estimated that 10% of women seeking fertility treatment are diagnosed with DOR. However, the success rate of medically assisted reproduction (MAR) is significantly lower in women with DOR, thus many seek additional approaches.              Aim:                    To explore the health needs of women with DOR, treatment options and experience of treatment including traditional complementary integrative medicine (TCIM).              Methods:                    Anyone with a diagnosis of DOR, living in Australia or New Zealand, aged over 18 were invited to complete an online survey distributed via fertility support networks and social media platforms from April to December 2021.              Results:                    Data from 67 respondents were included. The main aspects of health that were impacted by DOR were fertility (91.0%) and mental health (52.2%). The main treatment recommended was MAR with most women either currently using MAR (38.8%) or having previously used MAR (37.3%). TCIM was widely used with 88.1% of women utilising supplements, 74.6% consulting with TCIM practitioners, and 65.7% adopting self-care practices. The main reasons for using TCIM were to improve fertility or support pregnancy, and to support general health and well-being.              Conclusions:                    Women with DOR have additional health needs apart from infertility, most notably mental health support. The main form of treatment utilised is MAR, despite DOR being challenging for fertility clinicians. TCIM was widely used, and respondents perceived benefits related to improving fertility, supporting pregnancy, or improving well-being through use of acupuncture, meditation, naturopathy, massage, yoga."

Methods:                    Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (n = 33,557) were analyzed to assess associations between presence of multiple chronic conditions (n = 13) and CAM use, using multivariable relative risk and linear regressions weighted for complex NHIS sampling. CAM use was defined as self-reported use of one or more of 16 therapies in the previous 12 months.              Results:                    Chronic conditions were common. US adults reported one (22.3%) or 2 or more (33.8%) conditions. Many used at least one form of CAM. Multivitamins, multiminerals, or both (52.7%); vitamins (34.8%); and minerals (28.4%) were the most common. Compared with adults with no conditions, adults with 2 or more conditions were more likely to use multivitamins or multiminerals or both, vitamins, minerals, nonvitamins or herbs, mind-body therapies, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, massage, movement therapies, special diets, acupuncture, naturopathy, or some combination of these therapies (P <.003).              Conclusion:                    People with multiple chronic conditions have a high prevalence of CAM use. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the association between CAM use and chronic disease prevention and treatment."
Clara's birth.,"Thorens S, Richer D, Bel A, Bel B.",Midwifery Today Int Midwife. 1999 Summer;(50):54-7.,10478058,"Advocacy for homebirth is based on the strong assumption that birthing is a physiological process and does not require medical interventions unless things turn ""wrong."" Let us assume that something might always go wrong, for instance during Clara's birth when the placenta was still retained after three hours. What needs to be done? The moment the midwife entered the house she was endowed with a responsibility for any problem caused by her failure to give proper guidance. With this weight on her shoulder, and according to her training and experience, there was no other way for her than to suggest an intervention regarding the placenta. The two midwives, B, and C., might not agree on risk estimations, the nature of the intervention, whether it should be performed at home or in a hospital. The estimation of abnormalities, evaluation of risks and the procedures with which to handle them are the main practical difference between classic obstetrics and non-interventionist midwifery--by analogy, between allopathy and naturopathy. The rest (positive thinking) is basically literature. A delivery will not remain normal just because we decide it ""must"" be physiological. Dr. Barua, a professor of obstetrics in Pondicherry, pointed out that normal deliveries are rare--fewer than 10 percent in South India. What we have instead is either pathological or ""natural"" deliveries in which regenerative processes take care of abnormal situations. Unless she has developed sensitive hands, a birth assistant or midwife must rely on monitoring procedures to evaluate deviations from the normal process. Even with the greatest care, these procedures are intrusive in that they disconnect the parturient from her own sensations. While successful unattended homebirth stories emphasise the extraordinary power and sensitivity of a birthing woman, the whole dream seems to collapse in abnormal or pathological cases. It would have collapsed for Sonia as well, had she not discarded negative suggestions. Dependency on medical experts is an alienation by which the patient is forced to tolerate what is not tolerable to her at a precise moment. The trauma of medicalized birth is not surprisingly associated with rape. It remains that the leitmotif in homebirth literature is more ""empowerment,"" self assertion, militancy for the freedom of choice and ownership of her own body, than ""self reliance"" which involves a long-term sensitisation. Even outstanding essays a advocating non-medicalized birth may contain a sentence with implicit fear talk defusing the argument. For instance: ""And if need be, [the midwife] can transport you to the hospital if you truly need the help that only modern obstetrics can provide....""] The sentence may be countereffective to a reader who is insecure about homebirth. The problem lies in the proximity of ""truly"" and ""only."" It was indeed the writer's intention to emphasise ""truly"" with an interrogative connotation: ""Are you sure you need it?"" However, the effect is overruled by the assertive strength of ""only."" The reader's unconscious reading may be that, truly, she needs the help that only modern obstetrics can provide. This is an example of negative suggestions conveyed by confidence building talk about health and pregnancy. Another example was Denis and Sonia's obsession with the placenta retention problem that had been causally exposed by midwife B. Why should her empowerment end suddenly when there is a life threatening complication during the delivery? If the pregnant woman claims a fundamental right to choose her way of birthing in uncomplicated cases, she needs even more self determination when she is in real danger. This paradox is striking evidence that the common sense attitude toward danger is affected by the ""allopathic mind."" It sets up an insurmountable barrier between the physiological and the pathological, whereby symptoms are failures of the normal regenerative processes. Hence, testimonies of women feeling that their bodies ""b"
Phenanthrenoid Coelogin Isolated from Coelogyne cristata Exerts Osteoprotective Effect Through MAPK-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathway.,"Prakash R, Mishra T, Dev K, Sharma K, Kuldeep J, John AA, Tripathi A, Sharma C, Arya KR, Kumar B, Siddiqi MI, Tadigoppula N, Singh D.",Calcif Tissue Int. 2021 Jul;109(1):32-43. doi: 10.1007/s00223-021-00818-3. Epub 2021 Mar 6.,33675370,"Osteoporosis is a major health problem in postmenopausal women globally. This study determined the mechanism through which coelogin stimulates osteoblastogenesis and its osteoprotective and bone regenerating potential. Coelogin effect on primary calvarial osteoblast cells was determined by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, osteoblast survival, and apoptosis and protein expression studies. The osteoprotective effect of coelogin was also evaluated on osteopenic adult female Swiss mice. At autopsy, bones were collected for dynamic and histomorphometry studies. Serum samples were also collected for assessment of serum parameters. Coelogin treatment led to increased osteoblast proliferation, survival, differentiation, and mineralization in osteoblast cells. Coelogin supplementation to Ovx mice promoted new bone formation, prevented Ovx-induced deterioration of bone microarchitecture, and enhanced bone regeneration. In addition, signaling studies revealed that coelogin treatment activates the ER-Erk and Akt-dependent signaling pathways which stimulate the osteoblastogenesis in osteoblast cells."
[Development of a Rehab-Wiki for rehabilitation-Related Educational Materials Assigned to Competence-Based Learning Objectives].,"Schmidt S, Mau W.",Rehabilitation (Stuttg). 2019 Apr;58(2):128-135. doi: 10.1055/a-0847-7344. Epub 2019 Feb 22.,30795025,"Purpose:                    For adequate rehabilitative care, it is indispensable to impart appropriate competences in medical education based on learning objectives. In addition to the ""National Competence-Based Learning Objectives Catalogue for Medicine (NKLM)"", a competence-based learning objectives catalogue for the field of rehabilitation in the interdisciplinary subject ""Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine, Naturopathy"" (RPMN) was recently presented. These learning objectives were to be assigned to a wide variety of teaching materials of different media types and made easily accessible to university lecturers in a free online database. The database should also contain flexible teaching and learning modules as well as information on didactic methods.              Methods:                    Teaching materials from six university locations were assigned to the rehabilitation-related learning objective sections of the competence-based learning objective catalogue for RPMN and the NKLM. Presentation slides and text-based material were integrated in PDF-format. Educational films were embedded in a non-public channel on the video platform ""YouTube"". As a result, they could be referenced in the online database designed as a MediaWiki.              Results:                    The contents of this ""rehab-wiki"" (www.rehawiki.uni-halle.de) were structured using four thematic portals: The ""Teaching and Learning Objectives Portal"" contains the competence-based learning objectives and keywords for the content to be taught along with links to suitable didactic methods and available teaching materials. The ""Teaching and Learning Methods Portal"" contains didactic methods with detailed instructions. In the ""Teaching Materials Portal"" the teaching materials are grouped according to media type and the ""Glossary"" portal contains definitions and links to important rehabilitation medicine terms based on the ""Social Medicine Glossary"" published by the Federal German Pension Insurance. Just 6 months after implementation and presentation of the platform at a congress, 53 interdisciplinary users with teaching positions at German universities have registered.              Conclusions:                    The ""rehab-wiki"" provides an intuitive online database. It contains teaching materials of various media types, which are assigned to competence-based learning objective sections, and suitable didactic methods. Teachers are supported in designing learning goal-oriented, didactically advanced and appealing rehabilitation courses. The MediaWiki-system enables constant further development by the teaching community requiring low long-term supervision effort. The ""rehab-wiki"" also offers a starting-point for continuing education and advanced training as well as for other occupational groups involved in rehabilitation."

The conventional treatment makes use of medications, physiotherapy, occupational, speech, and diet therapies, while the complementary treatment makes use of homeopathy, naturopathy, massage, and acupuncture. The structure, process, and outcomes of stroke rehabilitation using conventional or complementary treatments have not been empirically investigated in Ghana.              Aims:                    This study aims to investigate the structure, process, and outcomes of stroke rehabilitation at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) in Accra and Kwayisi Christian Herbal Clinic (KCHC) in Nankese-Ayisaa, Ghana, and to explore the experiences of persons with stroke.              Methods:                    This study involves a mixed methods approach. This study will utilize three study designs, namely, cross-sectional, hospital-based cohort, and qualitative exploratory study designs. The objectives of the study will be achieved using three phases, namely, phase one will recruit health professionals and gather information on the structure and process of stroke rehabilitation at a conventional and complementary hospital using adapted questionnaires; phase two will determine the outcomes of stroke patients attending a conventional and complementary hospital facility at baseline, 2-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up using outcome measures based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model; and phase three will explore the experiences of stroke patients who use complementary or conventional treatment using an interview guide.              Data analysis:                    IBM SPSS Statistics Version 27 will be used to analyze the data using descriptive and inferential statistics. Repeated measures of ANOVA will be used to determine the differences between variables at baseline, 2-, 3-, and 6-month post-stroke. The qualitative data will be transcribed and entered into Atlas Ti version 9.0. The data will be coded and analyzed using thematic areas that will be generated from the codes.              Conclusion:                    The study protocol will provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, process, and outcomes of stroke rehabilitation in Ghana, incorporating both conventional and complementary treatment and rehabilitation into the stroke recovery journey.

Methods: The present study is a nationwide door-to-door survey conducted using a questionnaire/screening form. The data were collected from a national survey conducted under the Niyantrit Madhumeh Bharat (NMB) program initiated by The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy (AYUSH), Government of India, from all major zones of the country. A total of 162,330 participants who joined the NMB program were recruited in our study. Results: Out of the total respondents to the survey, it was observed that 11.8% [13,336/112,735] practice yoga, which was highest in the north zone [4,567/112,735] and lowest in the east zone [971/112,735]. Out of 101,643 respondents, 94,135 of the individuals who participated in the survey believed that yoga improved their lifestyle, and 90,102/98,518 believed that yoga prevented diabetes, revealing a huge knowledge-practice gap. Conclusions: The scale of the knowledge-practice gap coupled with the general acceptability of yoga calls for a change in the conventional healthcare provisions by its integration with modern medicine. The population-wide positive perceptions about yoga as a preventive health tool can not only catalyze consensus disease-specific yoga modules but also bridge the knowledge-practice gap that exists because of limited yoga centers and professionals."

There is an overwhelmingly increasing list of agents currently being tested for efficacy against cancer. In accordance with the concept that therapeutic agents must have fewer off target effects and considerable efficacy, TRAIL has emerged as one among the most deeply investigated proteins reportedly involved in differential killing of tumor cells. Considerable killing activity of TRAIL against different cancers advocated its entry into clinical trials. However, data obtained through preclinical and cell culture studies are deepening our understanding of wide-ranging mechanisms which induce resistance against TRAIL-based therapeutics. These include downregulation of death receptors, overexpression of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, imbalance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, and inactivation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Substantial fraction of information has been added into existing pool of knowledge related to TRAIL biology and recently accumulating evidence is adding new layers to regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Certain hints have emerged underscoring miR135a-3p- and miR-143-mediated regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and natural agents have shown remarkable efficacy in improving TRAIL-based therapeutics by increasing expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs. In this review, we summarize most recent breakthroughs related to naturopathy and strategies to nanotechnologically deliver TRAIL to the target site in xenografted mice. We also set spotlight on positive and negative regulators of TRAIL-mediated signaling. Comprehensive knowledge of genetics and proteomics of TRAIL-based signaling network obtained from cancer patients of different populations will be helpful in getting a step closer to personalized medicine."

Randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy and short-term safety of these therapies.              Purpose:                    To review randomized, controlled trials of CAM therapies for menopausal symptoms in order to better inform practice and guide future research.              Data sources:                    Searches of MEDLINE for articles published from January 1966 through March 2002, of the Alternative and Complementary Database (AMED) of the British Library for articles published from January 1985 through December 2000, and of the authors' own extensive files. Search terms were hot flash/flush, menopause, and climacteric, combined with phytoestrogens, alternative medicine, herbal medicine, traditional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ), Ayurveda, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, yoga, relaxation therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and therapeutic touch.              Study selection:                    29 randomized, controlled clinical trials of CAM therapies for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms were identified; of these, 12 dealt with soy or soy extracts, 10 with herbs, and 7 with other CAM therapies.              Data extraction:                    Each author extracted information from half of the studies on the number of patients, study design, outcome measures, and results; the other author then checked these results.              Data synthesis:                    Soy seems to have modest benefit for hot flashes, but studies are not conclusive. Isoflavone preparations seem to be less effective than soy foods. Black cohosh may be effective for menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes, but the lack of adequate long-term safety data (mainly on estrogenic stimulation of the breast or endometrium) precludes recommending long-term use. Single clinical trials have found that dong quai, evening primrose oil, a Chinese herb mixture, vitamin E, and acupuncture do not affect hot flashes; two trials have shown that red clover has no benefit for treating hot flashes.              Conclusions:                    Black cohosh and foods that contain phytoestrogens show promise for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Clinical trials do not support the use of other herbs or CAM therapies. Long-term safety data on individual isoflavones or isoflavone concentrates are not available."

This study investigated the safety, physiological, and psychological effects of a medically supervised fasting (MSF) regimen on healthy volunteers. Methods In this observational study, 117 female participants with an average age of 21.02 (± 1.45) years underwent 10 days of medically supervised fasting. Daily symptom scores and 24-hour food recalls were collected, along with serum levels of vitamin D and calcium, a complete blood count, anthropometric measurements, quality of life (QoL), and subjective mood, anxiety, and depression scores, at the baseline and at the end of fasting. Results Compared to baseline, significant improvements were observed in vitamin D levels (z = -8.79, p = 0.000), calcium levels (z = -4.08, p = 0.000), red blood cell count (z = -4.61, p = 0.000), and hemoglobin levels (z = -5.57, p = 0.00). Improvements were observed in physical QOL (t (116) = -4.51, p = 0.000); psychological QOL (t (116) = -4.70, p = 0.000); and social QOL (t (116) = -2.68, p = 0.008). We also observed significant reductions in body weight (55.83 (±11.38), 52.99 (±10.94); p = 0.00) and other anthropometric measures. More than 80% (n = 94) experienced at least one symptom associated with fasting. The symptoms associated with fasting changed significantly (p<0.05), with most symptoms peaking from day 3 to day 7 of fasting with remission from day 8 onwards. Conclusion Our findings suggest that MSF is associated with significant improvements in physiological and psychological variables. The symptoms associated with MSF are to be considered in clinical decision-making, and follow-up of patients on fasting therapy, particularly during the peaking of symptoms, may be warranted."

A dose-dependent (optimum 25 mg/mL medium) and significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced cytotoxic activity towards the BT474 cells was demonstrated. In vivo experiments on the antitumor activity of ME-A and ME-M were performed in a BALB/c-mouse / BT474 ductal breast carcinoma model. ME-A and ME-M were intratumorally administered according to an application schedule which was found to be optimal concerning dosage and time of administration. Standardized intratumoral application of ME-A and ME-M induced a significantly (p < 0.05) decreased tumor weight in experimental mice. Histological investigations were performed comprising analysis of mitosis and proliferation rates (Ki67 expression), as well as necrosis and apoptosis induction (ssDNA detection). As compared to tumors of control mice with intratumoral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections, tumors of the ME-A and ME-M treated groups showed a decreased cell proliferation rate, as well as an increased cell necrosis and apoptosis rate. Standardized mistletoe extracts, interfering with defined tumor cell functions, e.g., proliferation, necrosis and apoptosis, may have an impact on local cancer treatment."
Assessment of pulmonary functions among traffic police personnel in Chennai city - A comparative cross-sectional study.,"Sasikumar S, Maheshkumar K, Dilara K, Padmavathi R.",J Family Med Prim Care. 2020 Jul 30;9(7):3356-3360. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1126_19. eCollection 2020 Jul.,33102296,"Background:                    Air pollution due to road traffic is a solemn health hazard and vehicular emissions due to huge population in the cities are the main reason for the air quality crisis. The study was conducted to assess the degree of impairment in lung function in traffic police personnel exposed to traffic pollution compared to less-exposed healthy subjects.              Materials and methods:                    This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 250 traffic police personnel, aged 20-55 years, working in Chennai city, as compared to a matched control group, consisting of 250 less-exposed subjects. Measurement of pulmonary function testing was done with an RMS Helio 401. Statistical analysis was carried out with R statistical software.              Results:                    The traffic police personnel had significantly (P < 0.05) declined FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio and FEF 25-75% (L/s) as compared to controls. Traffic personnel with longer duration of exposure showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced lung functions than those with shorter duration. We have found a significant negative correlation with all pulmonary function parameters such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, and FVC 25%-75% among the traffic police personnel.              Conclusion:                    The impairment of pulmonary function among the traffic police personnel might be due to the effect of pollution by vehicular exhausts and they should be offered personal protective or preventive measures."
Lycopus europaeus (Gypsywort): effects on the thyroidal parameters and symptoms associated with thyroid function.,"Beer AM, Wiebelitz KR, Schmidt-Gayk H.",Phytomedicine. 2008 Jan;15(1-2):16-22. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2007.11.001.,18083505,"The aim of the prospective two-armed open study was to examine the effect of Lycopi europaei herba on thyroid function and on associated symptoms during a 3-month follow-up phase. The study population consisted of patients with a basal TSH<1.0 mU/l and hyperthyroidism-associated symptoms. For the first time, the T3/T4 excretion in 24h urine was measured as a primary objective parameter. As secondary parameters, further hormones, the general condition and the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism were registered. The urinary T4 excretion was significantly increased in Lycopus europaeus-treated patients (p=0.032). It is supposed that renal mechanisms cause the increased T4 excretion either by a modification within the glomeruli or by impaired reabsorption. Symptoms being specific to the thyroid gland were diminished, as e.g. the increased heart rate in the morning. The Lycopus europaeus preparation showed a good tolerance. These findings confirm positive effects of Lycopus europaeus in slight forms of hyperthyroidism."
Evaluation of the permeation of peat substances through human skin in vitro.,"Beer AM, Junginger HE, Lukanov J, Sagorchev P.",Int J Pharm. 2003 Mar 6;253(1-2):169-75. doi: 10.1016/s0378-5173(02)00706-8.,12593947,"Peat and various peat extracts have been successfully applied for a variety of clinical indications. Quite apart from the physico-thermal effects, new studies point towards the so-called ""chemical effects"" of peat containing substances. These effects include a stimulatory response of the spontaneous contractile activity (SCA) of smooth muscle (SM) tissue. The effects are, however, dependent on the possible permeability of pharmacologically active substances as naturally occurring ingredients of peat. Since peat is a mixture of various products it is necessary to examine the various peat types based upon their biological activity on SM tissue. In order to unequivocally prove the pharmacological activity of cutaneous peat treatment, in vitro permeation measurements of these actives across excised human skin can be used.HPLC analysis revealed that aqueous peat extracts contain up to 18 fractions of water-soluble compounds of fulvic and ulmic acids. These compounds have been found to have a stimulatory response on the contractile activity of SM tissue. In vitro diffusion studies showed that the permeability of these substances across human full thickness skin (thickness: 200 um(-1)) is highly selective and the resulting stimulatory activity is dependent on the permeated fraction. Especially, the HPLC fractions 7-11 and 14 are able to permeate human skin. Fractions 7-11 show a moderate stimulatory effect of SCA on SM for more than 90 min whereas fraction 14 shows the strongest stimulatory effect which was, however, suppressed after 87 min. These results show that the cutaneous therapy with peat treatment results in transcutaneaous permeation of biologically active fulvic and ulmic acid derivatives explaining the additional ""chemical"" effect of peat treatment in clinical practice."

Impact of Yoga as an Add-On Intervention on Neurocognitive Functions Among Adult Athletes: A Pilot Study.,"Halappa NG, Jha K, U V, Singh H.",Cureus. 2023 Sep 6;15(9):e44797. doi: 10.7759/cureus.44797. eCollection 2023 Sep.,37809141,"Background:                    Athletes are vulnerable to musculoskeletal injuries and psychiatric conditions. Previous studies have reported the benefits of yoga on cognitive functions among healthy children, adults, and the elderly. This pilot study aimed to test the neurocognitive functions among athletes with/without yoga intervention.              Methods:                    A non-randomized, two-armed parallel-group, single-blind comparative trial was used. The participants were grouped into (i) yoga with sports activity (YSA, n = 15) and (ii) sports activity alone (SA, n = 14). The subjects were assessed at the baseline and after a one-month intervention using digit span forward (DSF), digit span backward (DSB), Trail Making Test (TMT) A & B, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). A comprehensive one-hour yoga training three days a week for two months constitutes selected asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), relaxation techniques, and meditation techniques. The control group constitutes the routine sports activity for the same period.              Results:                    A paired sample t-test showed a significant improvement in cognitive performance on TMT A & B duration and RAVLT total score in the YSA group compared with the SA group. However, a significant trend was observed for DSF, DSB, and RAVLT immediate recall. Independent sample t-test (pre-post change scores) showed no significant group difference in cognitive performance, except there was a significant trend observed related to DSF (p = 0.053) and RAVLT distraction (p = 0.09), where the yoga group showed better performance in cognitive functions.              Conclusion:                    The results suggest that yoga may be integrated with sports to enhance neurocognitive functions."
Effect of Yoga on migraine: A comprehensive study using clinical profile and cardiac autonomic functions.,"Kisan R, Sujan M, Adoor M, Rao R, Nalini A, Kutty BM, Chindanda Murthy B, Raju T, Sathyaprabha T.",Int J Yoga. 2014 Jul;7(2):126-32. doi: 10.4103/0973-6131.133891.,25035622,"Context and aims:                    Migraine is an episodic disabling headache requiring long-term management. Migraine management through Yoga therapy would reduce the medication cost with positive health benefits. Yoga has shown to improve the quality of life, reduce the episode of headache and medication. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga as an adjuvant therapy in migraine patients by assessing clinical outcome and autonomic functions tests.              Subjects and methods:                    Migraine patients were randomly given either conventional care (n = 30) or Yoga with conventional care (n = 30). Yoga group received Yoga practice session for 5 days a week for 6 weeks along with conventional care. Clinical assessment (frequency, intensity of headache and headache impact) and autonomic function test were done at baseline and at the end of the intervention.              Results:                    Yoga with conventional care and convention care groups showed significant improvement in clinical variables, but it was better with Yoga therapy. Improvement in the vagal tone along with reduced sympathetic activity was observed in patients with migraine receiving Yoga as adjuvant therapy.              Conclusions:                    Intervention showed significant clinical improvement in both groups. Headache frequency and intensity were reduced more in Yoga with conventional care than the conventional care group alone. Furthermore, Yoga therapy enhanced the vagal tone and decreased the sympathetic drive, hence improving the cardiac autonomic balance. Thus, Yoga therapy can be effectively incorporated as an adjuvant therapy in migraine patients."

The definition and terminology of CAM is heterogeneous. The therapies, legal status, regulations and approaches used vary from country to country but there is widespread use by EU citizens. A coordination project funded by the EU has been launched to improve the knowledge about CAM in Europe.              Objectives and methods:                    The project aims to evaluate the conditions surrounding CAM use and provision in Europe and to develop a roadmap for European CAM research. Specific objectives are to establish an EU network involving centres of research excellence for collaborative projects, to develop consensus-based terminology to describe CAM interventions, to create a knowledge base that facilitates the understanding of patient demand for CAM and its prevalence, to review the current legal status and policies governing CAM provision, and to explore the needs and attitudes of EU citizens with respect to CAM. Based on this information a roadmap will be created that will enable sustainable and prioritised future European research in CAM. CAMbrella encompasses 16 academic research groups from 12 European countries and will run for 36 months starting from January 2010. The project will be delivered in 9 work packages coordinated by a Management Board and directed by a Scientific Steering Committee with support of an Advisory Board.              Output:                    The outcomes generated will be disseminated through the project's website, peer review open access publications and a final conference, with emphasis on current and future EU policies, addressing different target audiences."

It is resistant to the majority of chemotherapeutics and has a dismal prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a prevalent complication of chronic liver disease (CLD) in India. Primary liver cancer is the 6th most common cancer worldwide and the 4th most prevalent cause of cancer-related death. In 2018, it affected 841,000 people and caused 782,000 deaths around the world. Thus, research into the tumor cycle and its prevention through suitable herbal (Unani/Ayurvedic) medication is critical for reducing the impact of primary liver cancer. Treatment options for end-stage liver cancer are limited, necessitating costly liver transplantation, which is unavailable in most countries. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive literature survey to determine the benefits of using various herbs with liver protective and antioxidant properties. This information will be useful to researchers working on liver carcinoma and free radical scavenging, both of which are important in curbing potential carcinogens."

The MoA developed a mobile app, called AYUSH Sanjivani, to document the trends of the use of AYUSH-based traditional and holistic measures by the public across India. Analysis of the data generated through this app can help monitor the extent of the use of AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic and aid effective health promotion and communication efforts focused on targeted health care delivery during the pandemic.              Objective:                    The purpose of the study was to determine the extent of use of AYUSH measures by the public in India for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic as reported through the AYUSH Sanjivani mobile app.              Methods:                    Cross-sectional analysis of the data generated through the Ayush Sanjivani app from May 4 to July 31, 2020, was performed to study the pattern and extent of the use of AYUSH-based measures by the Indian population. The responses of the respondents in terms of demographic profile, use pattern, and benefits obtained; the association between the use of AYUSH-based measures and symptomatic status; and the association between the duration of use of AYUSH-based measures and the outcome of COVID-19 testing were evaluated based on bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.              Results:                    Data from 723,459 respondents were used for the analysis, among whom 616,295 (85.2%) reported that they had been using AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these 616,295 users, 553,801 (89.8%) either strongly or moderately agreed to have benefitted from AYUSH measures. Ayurveda and homeopathic measures and interventions were the most preferred by the respondents across India. Among the 359,785 AYUSH users who described their overall improvement in general health, 144,927 (40.3%) rated it as good, 30,848 (8.6%) as moderate, and 133,046 (40.3%) as slight. Respondents who had been using AYUSH measures for less than 30 days were more likely to be COVID-19-positive among those who were tested (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.44-1.60). The odds of nonusers of AYUSH measures being symptomatic if they tested positive were greater than those of AYUSH users (odds ratio 4.01, 95% CI 3.61-4.59).              Conclusions:                    The findings of this cross-sectional analysis assert that a large proportion of the representative population practiced AYUSH measures across different geographic locations of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and benefitted considerably in terms of general well-being, with a possible impact on their quality of life and specific domains of health."
Comparison of clustering and phenotyping approaches for subclassification of type 2 diabetes and its association with remission in Indian population.,"Tripathi P, Vyawahare A, Kadam N, Tiwari D, Biswas MD, Kathrikolly T, Sharma B, Vijayakumar V, Kuppusamy M.",Sci Rep. 2024 Aug 31;14(1):20260. doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-71126-7.,39217248,"Identification of novel subgroups of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has helped improve its management. Most classification techniques focus on clustering or subphenotyping but not on both. This study aimed to compare both these methods and examine the rate of T2D remission in these subgroups in the Indian population. K-means clustering (using age at onset, HbA1C, BMI, HOMA2 IR and HOMA2%B) and subphenotyping (using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) estimates) analysis was done on the baseline data of 281 patients with recently diagnosed T2D who participated in a 1-year online diabetes management program. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct clusters: severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), and mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) while subphenotyping showed four distinct categories: hyperinsulinemic, insulinopenic, classical, and nascent T2D. Comparison of the two approaches revealed that the clusters aligned with phenotypes based on shared characteristics of insulin sensitivity (IS) and beta cell function (BCF). Clustering correctly identified individuals in nascent group (high IS and BCF) as having mild obesity related diabetes which subphenotyping did not. Post-one-year intervention, higher remission rates were observed in the MOD cluster (p = 0.383) and the nascent phenotype showing high IS and BCF (p = 0.061, Chi-Square test). In conclusion, clustering based on a comprehensive set of parameters appears to be a superior method for classifying T2D compared with pathophysiological subphenotyping. Personalized interventions may be highly effective for newly diagnosed individuals with high IS and BCF and may result in higher remission rates in these individuals. Further large-scale studies are required to validate these findings."

Epub 2022 Mar 21.,35444369,"Background:                    Chanting ""OM"" is a form of meditation that has numerous health benefits. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning its effect are surprisingly scarce. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of OM chanting on autonomic modulation, using heart rate variability (HRV), on experienced yoga practitioners and yoga naïve persons.              Methods:                    This prospective study included 19 yoga practitioners (9 females and 10 males; group mean age ± standard deviation [SD]; 25.9 ± 3.2 years) and 17 yoga naïve persons (8 females and 9 males; group mean age ± SD; 24.8 ± 3.6 years) of both sexes and similar age range. Both the groups were assessed for HRV indices (time and frequency domain measures) before and after loud OM chanting for 5 min.              Results:                    Baseline comparison using Mann-Whitney U test between groups showed yoga practitioners had significantly increased high frequency (HF) power (P < 0.029) than nonyoga practitioners, signifying a state of tranquility before the chanting of OM. After 5 min of loud chanting of OM, a comparison between groups assessed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test revealed: HF Power, a component of the parasympathetic nervous system, was further amplified with a significantly increase (P < 0.001) in the yoga practitioners group compared to nonyoga practitioners. Furthermore, this increase in HF power was positively correlated with the years of experience in yoga.              Conclusion:                    The present study showed that a brief chanting of OM (5 min) might enhance parasympathetic nervous system activity, promote relaxation, and provide calmness. Further, this experience may be achieved effectively in individuals experienced in yoga than nonyoga practitioners."

Various Yogic techniques are found to be beneficial in the management of T2DM. Mind Sound Resonance Technique (MSRT) is one of the yoga-based meditation techniques observed to be effective in clinical settings.              Methods:                    Thirty-two patients with T2DM were randomized to either MSRT or supine rest (SR) sessions on two separate days separated by a washout period of one day. Fasting blood glucose levels were measured before and immediately after the sessions. State anxiety and subjective feeling of relaxation were assessed using Spielberg's state anxiety inventory (STAI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) respectively.              Results:                    There were significant differences between MSRT and SR groups in fasting blood glucose (p=0.019), STAI scores (p<0.001) and subjective relaxation (p<0.001). Within group analyses revealed significant reductions (p<0.001) in fasting blood glucose and STAI scores, along with an increase in subjective relaxation following the practice of MSRT, whereas, non-significant changes were found following the SR session.              Conclusions:                    A single session of MSRT was found to reduce blood glucose levels and state anxiety along with enhanced relaxation when compared to SR."

The need to impart teaching skills during postgraduation has gone unnoticed, hence Ramachandra Annual Postgraduate Teaching Skills (RAPTS), a teaching skills workshop, was conceptualized and implemented as postgraduate students serve as tutors/residents in the department to teach undergraduate medical students. This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching skills workshop for postgraduates.              Materials and methods:                    One hundred and seventy-eight postgraduate students of pre- and paraclinical department underwent the training in medical education principles and participated in the feedback. RAPTS Workshop was implemented as per the six-step approach. The learning was evaluated through a pre- and posttest scores. Student feedback was also obtained on the process overall objectives and contents of the workshop. Force-field analysis was performed.              Results:                    There was a significant learning by the postgraduates on various medical education principles as evidenced by significant improvement in the posttest scores (P < 0.05). Feedback regarding the general aspects of the workshop showed that 92% of the participants felt that the contents of the workshop suited their learning. Eighty-four percent of the participants opined that the presentations of the sessions were good and 91% felt that time management was good. Force-field analysis indicated that the factors favoring teaching skills workshop were higher.              Conclusion:                    This study has highlighted the importance of including teaching methodology training in the postgraduate curriculum that helps in grooming the future teachers in the right direction, in the right time. Competencies related to teaching skills based on medical education principles can be included in the postgraduate curriculum."
Computerized dynamic pupillometry as a screening tool for evaluation of autonomic activity.,"Venkata Sivakumar A, Kalburgi-Narayana M, Kuppusamy M, Ramaswamy P, Bachali S.",Neurophysiol Clin. 2020 Oct;50(5):321-329. doi: 10.1016/j.neucli.2020.09.004. Epub 2020 Oct 11.,33051091,"Objectives:                    Dynamic pupillometry is a simple screening tool for quantifying pupillary light reflex (PLR), to indicate autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard method for assessing ANS effects on the heart. The present study aimed to compare ANS activity as measured using dynamic pupillometry (DP) with short term HRV in healthy volunteers.              Methods:                    The study includes 200 participants aged between 20-60 years. PLR was measured using infrared videography and categorized into different quantitative parameters that reflect ANS activity. Simultaneously, Lead II ECG was recorded for 5 min to evaluate the short term HRV of time and frequency domain parameters. The data obtained from the two methods were compared with each other to provide the relationship between PLR and HRV.              Results:                    Study participants' mean age was 36.95 ± 9.45 years. The different pupillary indices of PLR and all the HRV parameters were within the range of normative data. Several PLR indicators of the parasympathetic function include mean constriction velocity (MCV; r = 0.60, P < 0.001), absolute constriction amplitude (ACA; r = 0.57, P < 0.001) baseline pupil diameter (BPD; r = 0.44, p < 0.001), and minimum pupil diameter (MPD; r = -0.35, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with high-frequency power (HF in normalized units) of HRV signal.              Conclusion:                    PLR variables showed a significant relationship to HRV indices. Dynamic pupillometry can be a complementary tool to HRV for evaluating ANS activity."
Dietary and Nutritional Interventions for the Management of Endometriosis.,"Abulughod N, Valakas S, El-Assaad F.",Nutrients. 2024 Nov 21;16(23):3988. doi: 10.3390/nu16233988.,39683382,"Endometriosis is a chronic, complex, systemic inflammatory condition that impacts approximately 190 million girls and women worldwide, significantly impacting their quality of life. The effective management of endometriosis requires a multi-disciplinary and holistic approach, one that includes surgical and medical management, such as a laparoscopy and a chronic medical management plan, as well as dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle adjunct interventions, such as pelvic pain physiotherapy and acupuncture. There is growing evidence to support the role of dietary and nutritional interventions in the adjunct management of endometriosis-related pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the implementation of these interventions is often not regulated, as patients with endometriosis often adopt self-management strategies. Diet and nutrition can modulate key players integral to the pathophysiology of endometriosis, such as, but not limited to, inflammation, estrogen, and the microbiome. However, it is unclear as to whether diet plays a role in the prevention or the onset of endometriosis. In this review, we discuss three key players in the pathogenesis of endometriosis-inflammation, estrogen, and the microbiome-and we summarize how diet and nutrition can influence their mechanisms, and consequently, the progression and manifestation of endometriosis. There is a major need for evidence-based, non-invasive adjunct management of this debilitating disease, and diet and nutritional interventions may be suitable."

Inflammatory responses elicited from a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) that had been pretreated with vitamin D3 (VD3) were compared after stimulation with purified LOSs from standard immunotype strains. The neutralizing effects of normal human serum and serum from mice immunized with strain B:2a:P1.5,2:L3 were compared. LOSs of immunotypes L3, L7, L8, and L9 induced significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, compared with other immunotypes. Normal human serum neutralized the proinflammatory responses to LOSs of all immunotypes tested. Immune mouse serum neutralized inflammatory responses against LOSs from immunotypes with epitopes cross-reactive with L(3,7,9) moieties. Antibodies found in normal human serum and immune mouse serum to the oligosaccharide, core, and lipid A moieties of meningococcal endotoxin contribute to neutralizing activity."

Epub 2022 Jun 30.,36119194,"Background:                    Deficiency of vitamin D is widespread across the globe. Expectant women are one of the most vulnerable groups for vitamin D deficiency (VDD). Even in South India with abundance of sunlight, pregnant women are believed to be at a high risk of this deficiency. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of VDD in antenatal women, associate it with modifiable risk factors and evaluate its correlation with low birth weight.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, in Chennai, in 100 pregnant women in their last trimester on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and their vitamin D and calcium levels were assessed. A detailed history regarding physical activity, diet, and sun exposure were collected and results were analyzed.              Results:                    The point prevalence of VDD (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) level <20 ng/mL) among antenatal women in our study is 62%. Univariate analysis revealed that sun exposure and socioeconomic status were the significant factors associated with higher percentage of VDD. Linear regression analysis showed that only sun exposure was a significant predictor for serum 25(OH) D levels. VDD is also associated with increased risk of low-birth-weight babies.              Conclusion:                    VDD is highly prevalent among pregnant women in South India leading to adverse health consequences in the mother and offspring. Less physical activity, decreased sun exposure, darker skin complexion, lower socioeconomic status and lack of awareness are the major risk factors associated with VDD in our study population."

The overall prevalence of CAM use was estimated 37% with minor differences between age groups, but clear differences between male (29%) and female (44%) participants. 1-year prevalence of CAM use was 22% (16% males, 28% females). 1-year of CAM use was associated with a higher level of education in both men and women; with higher income in men; and with more actual diseases in women.              Conclusion:                    Findings indicate that awareness of CAM is high even among people ≥65 years. Estimates for the prevalence of CAM use confirm the relevance of this treatment sector in the healthcare system for the elderly."
The experiences of persons living with HIV who participate in mind-body and energy therapies: a systematic review protocol of qualitative evidence.,"Bremner M, Blake B, Stiles C.",JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep. 2015 Oct;13(10):41-9. doi: 10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2321.,26571281,"Review question/objective:                    The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the experiences and perceptions of persons living with HIV who participate in mind-body and energy therapies. The review will focus on the use of mind-body medicine and energy therapies that include meditation, prayer, mental healing, Tai Chi, yoga, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy. These mind-body and energy therapies are selected categories because they do not involve options that might be contraindicated to an individual's current treatment regime. More specifically, the review questions are:              Background:                    Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular adjunct to conventional medicine across global populations. Complementary generally refers to a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine whereas alternative refers to a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional treatments. The World Health Organization [WHO] defines CAM as distinct health-care practices that have not been assimilated into a country's mainstream health care system.The USA's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), formerly National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), organizes CAM into five medical system categories: whole medical systems, mind-body medicine, biologically based practices, manipulative and body-based practices, and energy therapies. Whole medical systems include homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Mind-body medicine includes meditation, prayer, mental healing, Tai Chi, yoga, art therapy, music therapy and dance therapy. Biologically based practices include dietary supplements, herbal supplements and a few scientifically unproven therapies. Manipulative and body-based practices include massage and spinal manipulation such as chiropractic and osteopathic. Energy therapies include Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy.The NCCAM, the Alternative Medicine's Strategic Plan for 2011-2015 and the Healthy People 2020 envision a society in which all people have the opportunity to live long, healthy lives. In most countries, life expectancy has increased, but unfortunately, the incidence of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes and depression continues to increase. Research findings indicate that the use of CAM is often greater among people living with a chronic or life threatening illness compared with the general population,Until the development of highly active antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in 1996, a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was considered to be a death sentence. The human immunodeficiency virus attacks the immune system and weakens a person's ability to combat infections and some types of cancer. Currently, there is no cure for HIV but because of lifesaving medications, the mortality rate has declined significantly. The disease is now considered a chronic illness and highly manageable. Effective treatment has resulted in approximately 35 million people worldwide still living with HIV at the end of 2012.Because HIV is no longer a death sentence but a chronic illness, there is a need to evaluate the experiences and perceptions of people using CAM, considering the prevalence of CAM use within this population. In the United States and Canada, the rate of CAM use among HIV positive persons is approximately 50% to 70%, whereas in Africa, rates of CAM use range from 36% to 68%. Popular forms of CAM among persons living with HIV include herbal or nutritional supplements, mind and body practices, and spiritual or religious healing. Worldwide, only a small percentage of persons who have access to ARVs refuse to take them and utilize CAM exclusively to treat their HIV infection.People living with HIV often report using CAM because they believe that these therapies will improve their overall health and well-being and provides them an opportunity to take some responsibility in managing their personal health, which includes medication side effects. However, the effect of CAM on an individual's physical health often cannot be measured physiologically, but may be felt or experienced.Understanding CAM use is essential so that health professionals will have the most accurate information about which integrative therapies may or may not be helpful for people living with HIV. As recommended by the Institute of Medicine report entitled, 'Integrative Medicine and Patient Centered Care', health professionals have a moral commitment to find innovative ways of obtaining evidence and expanding knowledge about diverse interpretations of health and healing. Research aimed at exploring patients' experiences and perceptions of mind-body and energy therapies is imperative so asto offer comprehensive care and promote shared decision making regarding complementary therapeutic options."
Disclosure to physicians of CAM use by breast cancer patients: findings from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study.,"Saxe GA, Madlensky L, Kealey S, Wu DP, Freeman KL, Pierce JP.",Integr Cancer Ther. 2008 Sep;7(3):122-9. doi: 10.1177/1534735408323081.,18956493,"Background:                    Physician awareness of their patients' use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is crucial, particularly in the setting of a potentially life-threatening disease such as cancer. The potential for harmful treatment interactions may be greatest when a patient sees a CAM practitioner--perceived as a physician-like authority figure--but does not disclose this to their physician. Therefore, this study investigated the extent of nondisclosure in a large cohort of cancer patients.              Methods:                    CAM use in participants of the UCSD Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study, a multicenter study of the effect of diet and lifestyle on disease-free and overall survival in women aged 18-70 years who had completed treatment for invasive breast cancer between 1995 and 2000, is investigated. Data regarding CAM use and disclosure were collected via a telephone-administered questionnaire in 2003-2004. This questionnaire asked about different CAM modalities, including those requiring a ""skilled CAM practitioner"" (acupuncturist, chiropractor, homeopath, or naturopath) for administration. Demographic data were obtained at the WHEL baseline clinic interview. Modality-specific disclosure rates were determined and a comparison of demographic variables of disclosers versus nondisclosers was conducted using 2 tests for categorical variables, and t tests for continuous variables.              Results:                    Of 3088 total WHEL participants, 2527 completed the CAM questionnaire. Of these, 2017 reported using some form of CAM. Of these, 300 received treatment from an acupuncturist, chiropractor, homeopath, or naturopath and also provided information on whether or not they disclosed this care to their conventional physician. The highest disclosure rate was for naturopathy (85%), followed by homeopathy (74%), acupuncture (71%), and chiropractic (47%). Among demographic characteristics, only education (P=.047) and study site (P=.039) were associated with disclosure. College graduates and postgraduates, in particular, were more likely to disclose CAM use to their physicians than those with lesser education.              Conclusion:                    Overall, moderately high rates of physician disclosure of CAM use for all modalities except chiropractic were observed. Education and study site associations suggest that disclosure may be greater when CAM use is more prevalent and possibly more socially accepted. These findings underscore the importance of open, destigmatized patient--physician communication regarding CAM use."

It is effective in reducing spasticity in stroke and other neurological conditions. The current study explores the immediate effect of ultrasound-guided dry needling on soleus muscle spasticity and thickness in individuals with stroke.              Methods:                    Approval was obtained from the Institutional Sub-ethics Committee of Dr. D. Y. Patil College of Physiotherapy, Pune. The trial was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India. Thirty stroke survivors having soleus muscle spasticity ranging from grade 1 to 4 on the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) were selected. Spasticity was also assessed using the Modified Tardeau Scale (MTS) and H-reflex. Soleus muscle architecture was assessed by using ultrasonography (USG). Participants received a single session of DN for the spastic soleus muscle. Pre and immediate post-DN outcome measures were assessed.              Results:                    Based on USG findings, the thickness of the soleus muscle significantly increased by 2.67 mm (p<0.001) after dry needling treatment. The MMAS showed decreased spasticity by 1.47 (p<0.001) for ankle plantar flexors. A significant reduction of H-reflex values by 1.4 mV (p<0.001) was noted. The MTS also showed a significant increase in the range of ankle motion by 2.7 (p<0.001). All these indicate an immediate reduction of spasticity following DN.              Conclusion:                    Based on the findings of the current study, we can conclude that a single session of USG-guided DN has an immediate beneficial effect on reducing soleus muscle spasticity and increased muscle thickness in individuals with stroke."

Data sources:                    Relevant data till January 2021 were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science using MeSH terms.              Study selection:                    Case-control studies having PCOS subjects as cases and healthy women as controls were selected provided; their basal DHEA levels were mentioned in the published articles.              Data extraction:                    Two authors independently extracted the articles and qualified the final studies.              Data synthesi:                    Pooled meta-analysis was done using random effect model and showed level of DHEA statistically significant in PCOS compared to healthy controls (SMD = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.59-1.71).Heterogeneity was statistically significant as well (I2 = 95%).              Conclusion:                    Thismeta-analysis on DHEA and PCOS has helped in generating evidence regarding the involvement of stress in the pathogenesis of PCOS."
Development and validation of a structured feedback questionnaire from postgraduates on various elements of postgraduate medical curriculum.,"Sugumar R, Kumar AP, Maheshkumar K, Padmavathi R, Ramachandran P, Ravichandran L, Anandan S, Vijayaraghavan PV.",Med J Armed Forces India. 2021 Feb;77(Suppl 1):S57-S64. doi: 10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.01.013. Epub 2021 Feb 2.,33612933,"Background:                    Medical Council of India, introduced the Post Graduate (PG) curriculum as 'Competency Based Medical Education' (CBME). Feedback from the end users is a vital step in curriculum evaluation. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to develop and validate a Structured Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ) for postgraduates, encompassing all the components of the PG-CBME curriculum.              Methods:                    SFQ was developed with 23 Likert based questions and four open ended questions. Content validation was done by Lawshe method. After getting institutional ethics clearance and informed consent, SFQ was administered to 121 final year PGs (response rate 100%). We performed Principal component analysis (PCA), Structural equation modeling (SEM), Chi squared test (χ2/df); goodness-of-fit index (GFI); adjusted GFI; comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Cronbach's alpha was done for estimating the internal consistency.              Results:                    The validation resulted in a three-factor model comprising of ""curriculum"" (42.1%), ""assessment"" (28%), and ""support"" (18.5%). Chi squared test (χ2/df ratio) < 2, CFI (0.78), GFI (0.72) and RMSEA (0.09) indicated superior goodness of fit for the three-factor model for the sample data. All the extracted factors had good internal consistency of ≥0.9.              Conclusion:                    We believe that this 23 item SFQ is a valid and reliable tool which can be utilized for curriculum evaluation and thereby formulating recommendations to modify the existing curriculum wherever required, facilitating enriched program outcomes."

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,28889840,"Introduction:                    Diabetes mellitus is a major global health problem. Needling at CV-12 has reduced blood glucose level in diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of needling at CV-12 (Zhongwan) on blood glucose level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).              Materials and methods:                    Forty T2DM patients were recruited and randomized into either the acupuncture group or placebo control group. The participants in the acupuncture group were needled at CV-12 (4 cun above the center of the umbilicus), and those in the placebo control group were needled at a placebo point on the right side of the abdomen (1 cun beside the CV-12). For both groups, the needle was retained for 30 minutes. Assessments were performed prior to and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.              Results:                    There was a significant reduction in random blood glucose level in the acupuncture group compared to baseline. No such significant change was observed in the placebo control group.              Conclusion:                    The result of this study suggests that 30 minutes of needling at CV-12 might be useful in reducing blood glucose level in patients with T2DM."
Yoga Techniques Associated with Improved Insulin Resistance in Women with PCOS: A Pilot Study.,"Verma A, Gandhi A, Sirdesai N, Chandra V.",Int J Yoga Therap. 2024 Dec 1;34(2024):Article 23. doi: 10.17761/2024-D-23-00056.,39888666,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a complex heterogenic disease of unknown etiology, is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Sufferers often exhibit significant insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, obesity, and dyslipidemia. There is no cure for PCOS, although metformin and weight reduction have shown some benefits. Yoga has become increasingly popular for its beneficial effects, including on physiological functions such as carbohydrate metabolism and lipid profile. We aimed to explore the potential associations between yoga practices and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Thirty-five newly diagnosed women with PCOS were enrolled in the study, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was performed on blood samples. Participants were then advised on yoga practices comprising kriya, postures and breathwork for 6 days a week for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, HOMA-IR was repeated. Results were compared using the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test. Our study showed a decrease in mean body weight from 64.90 ± 1.95 kg to 61.53 ± 1.71 kg (p = 0.001), in mean BMI from 25.66 ± 0.65 kg/m2 to 24.33 ± 0.56 kg/m2 (p = 0.001), in fasting blood sugar from 95.73 ± 3.23 mg/dL to 91.83 ± 2.17 mg/dL (p = 0.007), in fasting insulin from 14.89 ± 1.47 μU/mL to 11.47 ± 1.06 μU/mL (p = 0.0001), and in HOMA-IR from 3.76 ± 0.50 to 2.72 ± 0.32 (p = 0.0001). Yoga techniques were associated with improvements in insulin resistance in women with PCOS."
Herbal Traditional Chinese Medicine and suspected liver injury: A prospective study.,"Melchart D, Hager S, Albrecht S, Dai J, Weidenhammer W, Teschke R.",World J Hepatol. 2017 Oct 18;9(29):1141-1157. doi: 10.4254/wjh.v9.i29.1141.,29085558,"Aim:                    To analyze liver tests before and following treatment with herbal Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in order to evaluate the frequency of newly detected liver injury.              Methods:                    Patients with normal values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as a diagnostic marker for ruling out pre-existing liver disease were enrolled in a prospective study of a safety program carried out at the First German Hospital of TCM from 1994 to 2015. All patients received herbal products, and their ALT values were reassessed 1-3 d prior to discharge. To verify or exclude causality for suspected TCM herbs, the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) was used.              Results:                    This report presents for the first time liver injury data derived from a prospective, hospital-based and large-scale study of 21470 patients who had no liver disease prior to treatment with herbal TCM. Among these, ALT ranged from 1 × to < 5 × upper limit normal (ULN) in 844 patients (3.93%) and suggested mild or moderate liver adaptive abnormalities. However, 26 patients (0.12%) experienced higher ALT values of ≥ 5 × ULN (300.0 ± 172.9 U/L, mean ± SD). Causality for TCM herbs was RUCAM-based probable in 8/26 patients, possible in 16/26, and excluded in 2/26 cases. Bupleuri radix and Scutellariae radix were the two TCM herbs most commonly implicated.              Conclusion:                    In 26 (0.12%) of 21470 patients treated with herbal TCM, liver injury with ALT values of ≥ 5 × ULN was found, which normalized shortly following treatment cessation, also substantiating causality."

Development and Validation of a Yoga-Based Intervention for Speech Dysfunction and Speech Difficulties Among Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Some P, Ps V, M S, Fj N.",Cureus. 2024 Nov 23;16(11):e74287. doi: 10.7759/cureus.74287. eCollection 2024 Nov.,39717336,"Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily thought to be brought on by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. Communication difficulties are a common symptom of PD, affecting both motor speech and language systems. These challenges significantly impact the quality of life by reducing participation in communication, leading to social withdrawal, and increasing the risk of social isolation and stigma among individuals with PD. There are no established yoga protocols specifically addressing speech problems in PD. Hence, the research team aimed to develop and validate the yoga program targeting speech dysfunction and speech difficulties among patients with PD. Materials and methods The first part of this study involved developing a yoga-based intervention based on a review of classic literature and recently published research papers in the area of yoga and voice culture on PD. In the second step, 30 subject matter experts (SMEs) (yoga) confirmed the proposed module. The content-validity ratio (CVR) was determined using Lawshe's formula. The content validity was scored by these 30 SMEs in an independent manner on a three-point scale (0-2), with 'not essential' receiving 0, 'useful but not essential' receiving 1, and 'essential' receiving 2. Results Of the 68 practices selected for validation, 33 practices had a CVR score of ≥0.333, indicating high content validity. Thirty-five practices had a CVR score of <0.333, indicating low content validity. As a result, the final intervention module was created, consisting of 33 yoga practices with a CVR of 0.333. Conclusion A comprehensive and traditional literature-based yoga intervention module was developed and may be used as an intervention for speech difficulty in PD. Further studies are advocated to test the efficacy of the intervention."
