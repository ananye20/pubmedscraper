### pubmedscraper

Welcome to the PubMed Web Scraper repository! This tool is designed to streamline the process of extracting detailed information from the PubMed database based on user-specified search queries. Whether you're a researcher, student, or enthusiast looking to gather data for analysis, this scraper has you covered.

## How It Works
# User Input: 
The scraper first prompts the user to input their search term, specifying the details they want to extract from PubMed. This could include journal names, author details, PubMed IDs, citations, or any combination thereof.

# Data Retrieval: 
Once the search term is provided, the scraper initiates the process of data retrieval. It constructs the appropriate URL for the PubMed search query and proceeds to scrape the search results page using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.

# Multithreading: 
To expedite the scraping process, the scraper utilizes multithreading, enabling concurrent execution of scraping tasks across multiple pages of search results.

# Comprehensive Data Collection: 
The scraper meticulously extracts relevant information from each search result page, including journal names, author details, citations, and PubMed IDs.

# Data Aggregation: 
As the scraping progresses, the retrieved data is aggregated into a structured format, ready for further analysis.

# Excel File Generation: 
Once the scraping is complete, the aggregated data is organized into an Excel spreadsheet format. This makes it easy for users to download and analyze the data using familiar tools.
